# AGENTS.md

Notes for coding agents working on **Laki** (CLI `laki`): how the code works and how to change it
safely. User-facing docs: `README.md` (the short version: features, install, quick start) and `docs/guide.md` (the
full guide); the product, in `requirements/`. Laki is a successor to wb
(`~/projects/specdrop-cli`, tmux + iTerm). That repo is read-only from here; ideas and code are ported
from it (limits, hooks).

## Build, test, run

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck                 # tsc --noEmit
npm test                          # node:test, ~95s (4 at a time)
npm run pack                      # electron-vite build + electron-builder --dir → dist/mac-arm64/Laki.app (Intel: dist/mac)
npm run pack:x64                  # the Intel app from an Apple silicon Mac → dist/mac/Laki.app
npm run pack:linux                # in Docker: dist/linux/Laki-<version>-<arch>.AppImage, then the tests and pack-smoke.sh under Xvfb (ARCH=x64)
npm run dmg                       # minor version +1, then dist/release/Laki-<version>-arm64.dmg (the user's ask: every dmg)
npm run dev                       # Electron + renderer dev server on :5199
```

- **Tests** are `node --test` with type stripping (`test/*.test.ts`), no framework.
  - `test/helpers.ts` `fresh()` gives each test a temp `LAKI_HOME` and `HOME`, its own daemon, and the
    fakes in `test/fakes` first on PATH: `claude`, `codex`, `gh`, `open` (records what it would open), a shell `tsh`,
    `ssh` (every host is this machine) and `da-probe` (counts terminal query replies). No network.
  - `test/cloudflared` is a fake that's off PATH: a test links it into `$HOME/bin` (first on PATH) to install it.
  - Never let a test touch the real `~/.laki` (or `~/.laki-electron`), `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`. The rig also
    sets `LAKI_PAGE` to a folder of the test's own, so remote access never serves the build.
- **Trying the UI in a browser**:
  1. `npm run demo -- /tmp/laki-x` builds a temp world (a repo, 3 workspaces, fake agents) and a daemon
     that accepts the dev origin. It prints a URL with the port and token in the hash. To try Expose to the
     world, `ln -s $PWD/test/cloudflared /tmp/laki-x/bin/`.
  2. `npm run dev:web` serves the renderer on :5199; open that URL.
  3. Afterwards stop it: `LAKI_HOME=/tmp/laki-x/data node out/main/cli.js stop`, then stop vite.
- **Linux** (`scripts/linux.sh`, a preview): node:22-trixie with Electron's libraries; `npm ci` there gets node-pty's
  Linux binary. Main's `mac`: off it, the system's title bar (`autoHideMenuBar`: Alt shows the menu) and close quits
  (no Dock to bring a hidden window back); the renderer's `.electron` (the traffic lights' room) is macOS only. ⌘ keys
  are Super (`metaKey`); macOS-only parts (`open`, `afplay`, `screencapture`, the Keychain, `open-url` links, panel
  windows) fail quietly or fall back.
- `scripts/pack-smoke.sh` checks the packaged app (daemon, CLI and hooks through Electron's node, plus a
  window screenshot); `APP=$PWD/dist/mac/Laki.app` checks the Intel build (under Rosetta here). `scripts/mem.sh` measures RSS with 3 workspaces × 2 tabs.
- The user runs their own daemon with real agents in it, in `~/.laki-electron` (from when the app was called
  Laki Electron; `dataDir` in `src/shared/conn.ts` keeps an existing one). Never stop it and never point tests
  at it.
- Releasing: `docs/release.md` (checks, both builds, `scripts/pack-smoke.sh` once before each release).
- Release notes: `docs/release-notes.md`, Settings › Release notes (`?raw`, comments stripped). Each user-visible
  addition gets a line under `## Next` (add that heading above the newest version when it isn't there); `npm run dmg`
  stamps it as the version it builds and the date (`scripts/notes.ts`).
- Signing: the app is ad-hoc signed (`build.mac.identity: "-"`, `hardenedRuntime: false`), not notarized. Keep it:
  with `identity: null` (unsigned) a downloaded dmg (Slack, mail, a browser) says *"Laki" is damaged* on other Macs;
  ad-hoc, it says Apple could not verify it, and System Settings › Privacy & Security › *Open Anyway* opens it.
  `codesign --verify --deep --strict` on the built app must pass. A plain double-click everywhere needs a Developer ID
  and notarization.
- The app icon is `build/icon.icns`, rendered from the mark `src/renderer/src/icon.svg` (also the splash and the
  browser tab's icon) by `swift scripts/icon.swift`: change the SVG, then run it.

## Architecture

```
Laki.app (Electron)                          daemon (Electron's node, detached; or plain node)
  main: single instance, starts daemon  ──▶   127.0.0.1:<random>
        notifications, folder picker          POST /rpc    Authorization: Bearer <token>
  preload: conn/notify/pick/openExternal      GET  /ws?token=<token>   (WebSocket)
  renderer: React + xterm.js (WebGL)  ◀─WS─▶  token in <data>/daemon.json (0600); Origin must be
                                              file:// (the app) or absent (CLI); dev origins only via
laki CLI / hooks (node) ─────── /rpc ──────▶   LAKI_DEV_ORIGIN
browser elsewhere ─ cloudflared ─ GET / ───▶   the built renderer (remote access); its own token and
                                              origin while remote access runs
                                              per tab: node-pty + @xterm/headless mirror
                                              state.json, worktrees, queue, lsof/gh scans
```

### API

`src/daemon/main.ts` `api`: the same methods over HTTP and WebSocket. `API` (`src/shared/types.ts`) is in
every view as `api`; a running daemon below the renderer's (it outlives app updates) gets a yellow bar at the
top of the main area, *Restart Laki's daemon* (`StaleDaemon` in `ui.tsx`, `.stale-bar`; two clicks: `shutdown`, then main starts the new one).
Bump `API` when the renderer starts relying on a new method or daemon behavior (1: the tunnel methods; 2: a
project's `expose`, kept by `projectSet` and returned by `cloudflared`; 3: a project's `actions`, kept by `projectSet`;
4: `usage`; 5: remote access; 6: scheduled tasks, remote access forever; 7: `prComment`, `muted`; 8: a project's
`templates`, kept by `projectSet`; 9: browsers in `apps`, `openIn` `default`; 10: `send` `enter: false`; 11: a tab's `runAt`, `model` and `effort`, the
board's `todoAdd`/`todoRm`; 12: `doctor`, `wsArchive` `ifClean`, a workspace's `stat`; 13: a tab's `ask`, `answer`,
`unread`, `wsFan` and a workspace's `race`, `wsNew` `issue`, `browse`/`browseDone`; 14: settings' `prPrompts`, `prScan`,
`prTries`, which the PR switches' tooltips quote; 15: `webhookTest`, `wsNew` `pr`, the `archived` event; 16: `portKill`, a
workspace's `procs` and `portNames`, `fileRead` `base`; 17: `meme`; 18: `projectAdd` `host:path`, a project's and
workspace's `host`; 19: a workspace's `pinned`, kept by `wsSet`; 20: `fileWrite`, `fileRead` `lossy`; 21: a project's `seps` and `rows`, kept by `projectSet` and `reorder`; 22: `prRefresh`, `doctor`'s `cloudflared`; 23: `wsNew`/`wsFan` `place`; 24: `prAct`, an action's `any`; 25: `prDiff`, a sep's `color`, a PR's `mine`; 26: widgets: `widgetRender`/`widgetSet`/`widgetRun`/`widgetAction`/`widgetReload`, the view's `widgets`, `widgetKey`, `widgetHome`, `skillSet` `skill`; 27: a widget's `options` and `view`, `widgetSet` `view`, `openIn` `widget`; 28: `resources`, `tabSleep`/`tabWake`, a tab's `asleep`; 29: `logs`, settings' `devMode`, `widgetAction`'s `toast`/`modal`; 30: `progress`, a tab's
`progress`; 31: a sep's `template`, kept by `projectSet`; 32: `prAttach`, a project's `notes`, kept by `projectSet`; 33: `prAct` `merge`, a workspace's `autoLand`, a project's `pr` and
`mergeMethod` (`prAct`'s only; `projectSet` keeps it), `answer` `label`, `phoneTick`; 34: `quickNew`, a project's `kind`,
a workspace's `browser`, kept by `wsSet`; a shell tab's `running`; 35: `remoteStart` `open`, a remote's `open`; 36: `quickNew`'s Terminals, `terminal <n>` and a page's host as its name; 37: a project's `sort` and a sep's `sort`, kept by `projectSet`; 38: `prFiles`/`prViewed`, a PR's `approved` and `changes`, a tab's `runs`, a workspace's `artifacts`, `artifactList`, `fileRead` `storage`; 39: a workspace's `links`; 40: `keepPublished`, what agents publish kept as links; 41: `keepShells`, shells brought back after a restart; 42: Laki AI: `aiAsk`, `aiState`, `aiNew`, `aiStop`, `aiKey`, the `ai` event; 43: settings' `ai.preset`, the AI's links to workspaces; 44: `resources`' `others`, `resourceStop`; 45: a project's `memory`, kept by `projectSet`; 46: a PR's `approvedByMe`, `commentedByMe`; 47: `widgetFiles`, `widgetWrite`, a widget's `byAi`; 48: `widgetRm`, a widget's `place` and `net`, `widgetSet` `place`/`net`, `prList`, `aiQuestion`/`aiAnswer`, a chat message's `ask`, settings' `ai.skill` and `ai.hideCost`; 49: specs and brainstorms, `planList`/`planNew`/`planGet`/`planSave`/`planFile`/`planUpload`/`planWrite`/`planRm`, `GET /plan/…`, a project's `plans`; 50: a spec's or brainstorm's chat, `aiAsk`/`aiState`/`aiNew`/`aiStop`/`aiAnswer`
`chat`, `aiContinue`, `aiTick`, the `ai` event's `of` and `ended`, settings' `planTemplates`; 51: a workspace's `railPin`, kept by
`wsSet` (`RAIL_PINS` at most), `branches`' `main`, settings' `syncBase`; 52: a workspace's `related` and `from`, `wsSet` `unrelate`,
`wsNew` `link`/`from`, `prDetach`). A
setting the renderer adds needs no bump: `settingsSet` keeps any field.

- state: `ping`, `state`, `hook`, `watchLimits`, `shutdown`, `settingsSet` (merged into `state.settings`), `apps` (installed apps a folder can open in, `APPS`, and browsers, `BROWSERS`, flagged `browser`: only for a file), `openIn` (an app id, `editor`: the one in Settings, or `default`: macOS's for the file; with a `file`, Finder reveals it and a terminal opens its folder);
- projects and workspaces: `projectAdd`/`projectRm`, `projectSet` (name, config, `notes`: the user's Markdown, the
  project's ⋯ › Notes (`ProjectNotes`, panels.tsx), its page and Settings, left out of MCP's and `ls --json`'s state; `memory`:
  the project page's Memory, the whole list, likewise left out; `seps`: the sidebar's groups (the app's word: a
  named head over the workspaces up to the next one, its count beside it; a workspace dropped on it goes first in it (its top
  third: before it), `RowDrop` `into`, from `data-head`; a workspace's menu › *Move to group* (App's `groupItems`):
  first in one, or *Out of its group* (before the first), a submenu; groups are made only from the project's ⋯, at the top), each with a `color` of `TAB_COLORS` or none and a `template` (a prompt template's name: the new-workspace page opened from the group starts with it; none set: with no template, never the last one used) and a `sort` (`WS_SORTS`; unset: the project's), and the project's own `sort` (unset: manual; App's `sortedRows`: each group's workspaces in its sort, rows unchanged; last active: `laki.active`), and `rows`: their ids and its workspaces' in order; no seps, no rows), `reorder` (projects or workspaces by id; with a sep's id, its project's `rows` too), `wsSet` (color, `muted`, `pinned`: the sidebar's Pinned, above the projects; `railPin`: the rail's quick access, the time
pinned (their order), refused past `RAIL_PINS`, 5), `projectFile` (the repo's `.laki.json`), `branches` (`main`: origin's
HEAD, else main or master: the new-workspace page's base unless picked), `wsNew`/`wsRm`/`wsArchive`/`wsRestore`/`wsFork`;
- `wsNew` in a folder (or `local`) whose own workspace is there: an agent other than none, or a prompt, makes `another`
  beside it (named by the prompt's first words); none gives it back as it is (scheduled tasks' `local`). In development
  mode each step goes to `devLog('new', …)` (Settings › General › *Creation log*) and, once it has an id, the
  workspace's own log; `spawnTab` logs each tab's command line there;
- `quickNew` (`kind` shells or browsers, a browser's `url`; the sidebar's + › Terminal and Browser): the `Terminals` (`load` renames a `Shells` from 0.7) or
  `Browsers` project (`kind`, your home folder, `git: false`; made by the first one; never the home folder's own
  project: `projectAdd` and `findProject`'s path match skip it), then `wsNew` `local` `another` named `terminal <n>` (a
  shell tab) or `browser <n>` (no tabs, the workspace's `browser`: the page, `URL_OK`, http(s) or about:blank; `wsSet`
  `browser` and `name` follow the page and its title); one at a time (`quick`: two clicks would pick the same id);
- `wsNew`/`wsFan` `place` (`placeWs`, as a drag would: `top`, first in the project, or a sep's id, first under it; a
  race in its order; none: last, as the CLI's and scheduled runs are);
- the board's to-dos (`state.todos`, `view.todos`; a project's go with it): `todoAdd` (`project`, `text`), `todoRm`;
- `wsArchive` `ifClean`: archives only with nothing uncommitted (the worktree goes, and that with it), else returns `{ dirty }`;
  `doctor` (the first-run screen's: git, `gh auth status`, `cloudflared` (optional; Welcome's ? says what for), which agents are on PATH);
- tabs and agents: `tabNew`/`tabClose` (a tab's name: `addTab`, `freeName` numbers it; an agent tab after the
  workspace's first, with a prompt, is `<agent>: <taskTitle(prompt)>` (`shared/types.ts`: its first words, no URLs, paths,
  flags or please), `titled`; one without takes its first prompt's words, `titleFrom`: claude's UserPromptSubmit and
  gemini's BeforeAgent `prompt`, codex's first notify `input-messages`, never a bare /command; MCP's `laki_new_tab` takes
  a `name`), `tabSet` (name, color, `muted`; a name sets `titled`), `send` (`enter: false`: into the prompt, no Enter, escapes dropped; refused while the agent asks something), `queueClear`;
  `answer` (`tab`, `n` or `pick` first/last: a waiting agent's menu, below; `label`: refused unless choice `n` still says that), `unread` (its ● again: `done`, until a look clears it);
- a race (`wsFan`: the `NewWs` fields and 2–6 `presets`, agents only, worktrees only): `wsNew` per preset, one after
  another, named `<name>-<preset>`, sharing a random `race` id (the sidebar's flag; the renderer's `Compare.tsx`);
- an issue (`wsNew`/`wsFan` `issue`: a URL or number): `fromIssue` runs `gh issue view <ref> --json number,title,body,url`
  in the project; the prompt is "Work on GitHub issue #n: title", the URL, the body (8,000 characters at most) and the
  prompt given, the name `issue-<n>-<slug>`; the workspace keeps `issue`;
- a PR (`wsNew` `pr`: a URL or number; not local, not a race): `prHead` (`gh pr view <ref> --json …`; `ghSays` turns gh's
  failures into a line: not installed, signed out, not found), then `worktree add --detach` and `gh pr checkout <url>
  --branch <b>` in it (`b`: the head branch, a fork's `<owner>/<branch>`; refused when a workspace or the repo has it
  checked out: "already checked out in workspace <id>", which the app offers to open). A prompt that names a PR
  (`prIn`, no `pr`: `fromPRLink`) only links it: the workspace keeps `linked` as `prUrl` and `prLinked` (`autoPR` skips it, the app shows no
  switches: its branch isn't the PR's; a local one too: `scanPRs` takes any workspace with a `prUrl`; a branch move keeps
  it, `moveBranch`: a review's `gh pr checkout`; any `prUrl` scans as the workspace is made). Not with `from` (a session
  another workspace's agent started: `laki new` in an agent's tab or one a shell tab runs (`$LAKI_TAB`'s kind or `runs`; yours
  in a shell isn't), an agent's `laki mcp`, by `$LAKI_WORKSPACE`; Laki AI's has none): its prompt's PRs are what it came from, only `related`, unless `link` (`laki new --link`, MCP's `link`; gh
  failing: refused) names the one it's about (`guessed` false: kept). Every other GitHub PR and issue the prompt names (`refsIn`; not an issue
  workspace's: the issue's text names any) goes to `related` (`relate`: once, any case, the newest last, 20 at most) and, unnamed, is `pr-<n>-<slug>` (gh failing: `pr-<n>`); the renderer sends no
  template name for one. The base is the PR's, the name
  `pr-<n>-<slug>`; the workspace keeps `prUrl`, which `scanPR` asks for until `syncBranches` sees another branch, and a
  fork's `fork` (kept by `wsFork`): `projectConfig` reads the repo's `.laki.json`, never the fork's (its setup would run);
  a base with no local branch is `origin/<base>`;
- `settings.syncBase` (Settings › Git & worktrees; unset or '': off): `synced` before `worktree add` (not a PR's):
  `origin`, `git fetch origin <base>`, then the worktree off `origin/<base>` (`--no-track`: a push never goes to the
  base) and that as its `base`; `ff`, `git fetch origin <base>:<base>` first (git refuses one checked out or not a
  fast-forward: then as `origin`). A fetch has a minute; one that fails leaves the base as it was;
- files git ignores (`copyIncludes`, after `worktree add` in `wsNew` and `wsRestore`): `.worktreeinclude` (the repo's
  root) and `.laki.json` `copy` as gitignore patterns to `git ls-files -z --others --ignored`, copied from the repo with
  their mode; one already there stays, a source outside the repo (a link) or a destination outside the worktree is
  skipped; failures go to `daemon.log`, never fail the workspace;
- expose to the world: `cloudflared` (its version, none when missing; the default emails; with `ws`, its project's
  `expose`: what the popup starts from), `tunnelStart`
  (`ws`, `port`, `mails`: resolves with the URL), `tunnelStop`;
- worktree actions: `diff`, `run`, `ship`; the side panel's: `files`, `fileNew`, `fileRead` (text up to 512 KB, an image as a data URL, or binary: size only; `lossy`: not UTF-8; `base`: an image as `git show <diffBase>:<path>`, for Changes' before), `fileWrite` (`text`, `was`: the text the edit started from, refused as "changed since you opened it" when the file isn't that any more, unless `force`; only a whole UTF-8 text file; written in place, its mode kept; on a host, `cat >` over `sshIn`), `prThreads`, `prComment` (`path`,
  `line`, `side` LEFT/RIGHT, `body`: `gh api …/pulls/<n>/comments` at the PR's head commit; a 422 is "not in the
  PR's diff"), `prAct` (`act` approve, close or merge, each only where the project's `prAllows` says (`config.pr`:
  approve, close, merge on unless false, `land` off unless true; the daemon refuses, the app hides); merge: `method`
  squash/merge/rebase, saved as the project's `mergeMethod`, `deleteBranch`: `merge()`, `gh pr merge --<method>
  [--delete-branch] -R <host/owner/repo> -- <url>`: `-R` keeps gh off the worktree's git (no checkout, no local branch
  deleted), then a scan a second later), `prAttach` (`ws`, `pr`: a URL or number; the app's *Attach a PR…*, the status bar's *+ PR*, the info
  panel: a git workspace on a branch, no PR found, and related's *Make it this workspace's PR*): `prHead`, then `prUrl`,
  and `prLinked` when its head isn't the workspace's branch, the one before (`prUrl`, else the branch's) to `related`; a scan follows), `prDetach`
  (`ws`: a linked `prUrl` to `related`, the PR ⋯'s *Not this workspace's PR*; its branch's own is refused: the scan
  would find it again), `prDiff` (`gh pr diff` by the PR's URL, in `diff`'s shape: `diffFiles` reads each file's status and
  lines; Changes' *PR #n*), `prFiles` (GraphQL: the PR's node id and each file's `viewerViewedState`, VIEWED, UNVIEWED,
  DISMISSED; owner and repo from the PR's URL) and `prViewed` (`path`, `viewed`, `id`: `markFileAsViewed` /
  `unmarkFileAsViewed`; Changes' Viewed boxes, in both views, a ticked file folded and dimmed, *n/m viewed*), `prAct` (`act` approve or close: `gh pr review --approve` / `gh pr close` by the PR's URL, after the
  app's confirm; an open PR only), `imageSave` (the preview's screenshots too), `openIn` with a `file` (paths must stay inside the
  workspace: `inside`, links followed, by `realpath`);
- widgets (below): `widgetRender` (`id`, `full`: the filled HTML, a JS widget's as a whole page; null: no such
  view), `widgetSet` (`on`, `size`, `every`, `view`, `config`: each setting as text, made what its kind takes),
  `widgetRun` (fetch now), `widgetRm` (Settings' trash can, after `ask`: the folder, `rmSync` (a link: only it), and its
  store; never a built-in, nor your home, the data dir or `widgetHome()` itself; not MCP's nor Laki AI's), `widgetAction` (`action`, `arg`), `widgetReload`, `widgetFiles` (a widget's own files as text, 20 at most) and `widgetWrite` (`id`, `files`: Laki AI's and MCP's `laki_extension_write`; only `<data>/widgets/<id>`, never another root's id, the user's own there (no `by: 'ai'`) nor through a link, files left out kept; saved off with the store's `by: 'ai'`, the view's `byAi`, Settings' *by Laki AI* tag: its fetch is a model's shell command, so the user turns it on), `widgetTick` (`now`: tests move the
  clock; one asked for while it fetches runs once more after: `again`); `openIn` `widget` (its folder); `GET /widget/<id>?key=…`: a JS widget's page;
- the agent skill (Settings): `skills` (each with `skill`, laki or laki-widget, and `mcp`: the agent's `mcp add` command, shown, never run; for
  opencode, whose `mcp add` only asks questions, the JSON for `mcpIn`, its config file), `skillSet` with an `agent`
  (claude, codex, gemini, grok, opencode: `skill.ts` `AGENTS`, each one's home and `mcp add`), `on` and `skill`
  (`SKILLS`: laki, the default, or laki-widget: the widget creator's guide, its own folder and launcher, no MCP; it says
  extension and widget are one thing); `refreshSkills` at the daemon's start writes an installed skill that's out of date again (only one whose launcher has this data dir's `LAKI_HOME`);
- scheduled tasks: `scheduleSet` (makes one, or changes one by `id`: name, project, preset, ws, prompt, when, on;
  a new one without ws or preset gets `new`, or `local` without git, and the default agent), `scheduleRm`,
  `scheduleRun` (now), `scheduleTick` (`now`: tests move the clock); the CLI's `laki schedule`;
- resources and sleep (Settings › Resources): `resources` (one `ps -axo pid,ppid,rss,%cpu,command`: `app`, the app
  bundle's processes by `--type`, none on plain node, which the renderer names by main's `procs` IPC (each pid's
  holder: the window, a JS widget's or the video's frame (`framesInSubtree`: JS widgets share one process, one site),
  the preview's webview, a Browsers page (`Browser: <host>`, stop `browsers`: App unloads the pages not selected,
  `browsed`) or its sign-in window, an agent browser, the bubbles, the editor; the total splits out shell tabs and
  browsers) with a Stop each: main's `proc-stop` (the
  bubbles' windows destroyed until `floats` changes state, `parked`; an agent browser closed) or the page's own
  `laki-stop` event (the video closed, a widget unloaded until a click, the preview unloaded until
  *Load it again*); `daemon` with its heap; `tabs`, each live session's process
  tree, the program first; RSS in KB; `others`: what else the daemon runs, each child with what's under it, named by `own`
  (Laki AI's agent, a tunnel, remote access, an SSH host's master, a widget's fetch; the rest, short git/gh/lsof, in `app` by name), `resourceStop`
  (main.ts: `ai`, `remote`, `tunnel:<ws>:<port>`) for a row's Stop); `tabSleep` (now: `cantSleep`'s rules: claude or codex with a `resumeId`, idle, no queue or limit, not on a host),
  `tabWake`, `sleepTick` (`now`: tests move the clock; every 60 s);
- development mode (`settings.devMode`): `logs` (`key`: `ws:<id>` or `widget:<id>`): `core.ts` `devLog`'s lines, the
  last 500 per key in memory, a line among the last 6 again counted (`n`) and moved to the end, all let go when dev mode
  goes off; a line may be a function, called only in dev mode; PR scans, the PR switches' choices and why
  not (`autoPR`, `prFix`, `tellAgent`), queue deliveries, tabs' status changes (`turn`), widgets' fetches and actions;
- an agent's estimate: `progress` (`tab`, `pct` 0-100, `note`; `laki progress`, MCP's `laki_progress`): it returns what
  it stored (clamped, rounded), and the tab's view has it until the turn ends (`view` drops it on idle or exit, however
  the turn ended); `settings.progress` puts `LAKI_PROGRESS=1` in agents' env (`lakiEnv`) and
  the laki skill tells them to report every 20-30 s; claude and codex on this Mac are told at every start (`agentCmd`'s
  `PROGRESS_NOTE`: `--append-system-prompt`, `-c developer_instructions`; the skill loads only for Laki's own tasks), and
  claude's settings allow its `progress` command;
- Laki AI (below): `aiAsk` (`text`, `images`: paths `imageSave` gave; resolves with the answer), `aiState` (the
  conversation, `busy`, `elsewhere`: an ask at work in another chat, `ended`, `key`: one is saved, the last 100 calls,
  `totals`), `aiNew`, `aiStop` (none: any chat's ask), `aiKey` (`key`; empty removes it); each takes `chat` (a spec's or
  brainstorm's, `planChat`; none: the AI page's), and `aiContinue` (an ended chat taken up again), `aiTick` (`now`: tests
  move the clock; every 10 minutes);
- Laki AI's skill: `prList` (`project`, `who` mine/others/all: `gh pr list --state open` in the project, `ghLogin`
  for mine, each with the workspace that has it by `prUrl` or branch), `aiQuestion` (`text`, `options` 2-6, or `act`:
  `AI_ACTS` memory/schedule/tab/todo with `id`, `project`, `label`: Yes / No; only while `busy`; a chat message with
  `ask`), `aiAnswer` (`id`, `n`: the AI page's buttons; a pick is the next `aiAsk`, an `act`'s Yes is `remove` here,
  never the AI's own);
- specs and brainstorms (experimental, `settings.specs`; below): `planList` (`project`?), `planNew` (`project`, `kind` spec
  or brainstorm, `title`, `text`), `planGet`, `planSave` (`title`, `blocks`, `markdown`), `planFile` (`path`: text, or an
  image as a data URL), `planUpload` (`name`, `data` base64: `files/…`), `planWrite` (`path`, `text`: MCP's and Laki AI's,
  never README.md or spec.json), `planRm` (the app's, after `ask`); each takes `project`, `kind`, `slug`; off, each says so;
- plan limits: `usage`; remote access: `remoteStart` (`hours`, `mail`: resolves once there's a link),
  `remoteStop`, `remoteTick` (`now`: tests move the clock);
- terminals: `screen`, `input`, `resize`, `view`, `detach`;
- the agent browser: `browse` (`ws`, `op`: open, screenshot, click, fill, text; `url` (a path: the workspace's
  `$PORT`; localhost only), `selector`, `text`) goes to the newest client whose `view` says `browse` as a `browse`
  event (`req`: its id; an `id` would make it a reply), and waits up to 30 s for its `browseDone` (`id`, `ok`, `result` or `error`); a screenshot's PNG is saved
  (`imageSave`) and its path returned. The CLI's `laki browser`, MCP's `laki_browser`.

WebSocket events:
- `state`: the whole view, debounced 30 ms;
- `data` and `responder`: per tab;
- `turn`: waiting, done or limit, for notifications;
- `browse`: an agent browser op, for the app (above);
- `ai`: Laki AI's conversation and `busy`, as each message comes;
- `open` / `close`: the connection's own status.

`view` carries `tab` (the pane with the keyboard), `tabs` (every pane on screen), `focused` and `browse` (the app's
window: it can run the agent browser). Tabs on screen in a focused window get no ● (`viewed`/`setView` in `core.ts`).

### Asks

A waiting tab's view has `ask` (`shared/ask.ts` `askOf`, over the bottom 16 lines of its screen): numbered options
(`1.`, `2)`…), consecutive, at least two, one of them marked (❯ › > ▶ ● →), box borders stripped; the last such menu
wins (tested in `test/ask.test.ts`). `answer` reads it again, then sends ↑/↓ one at a time, 40 ms apart (a TUI reads
a burst as one key; `Session.appCursor` picks `ESC O` or `ESC [`), then ⏎. The renderer's ask bar (App.tsx) shows
them as buttons for the tab with the keyboard; a permission prompt's notification gets *Allow* / *Deny* (main's
`Notification` `actions`; main calls `answer` itself, `pick` first / last, so a closed window doesn't matter). `answer`
needs the tab waiting and takes one at a time (a second after its Enter too). A waiting tab's output has its menu read
again 300 ms later (`spawnTab`'s `onOutput`), and a view goes out when it isn't the ask the last pushed view gave (`askKey`, set in `changed`).

### Sessions

`src/daemon/session.ts`: every PTY is mirrored into an `@xterm/headless` terminal.

- **Attach** sends a snapshot, built with `@xterm/addon-serialize`, plus what serialize leaves out:
  cursor visibility and style, mouse encoding, scroll region.
- The live stream follows on the same socket, in order.
- Any number of clients can attach. The PTY takes the size of the one that typed or resized last (`resizeFor`,
  `follow`: a phone, then the Mac).
- **Exit**: a signal reports code 128+signal. A shell's exit, or a command's with code 0, closes its tab (`core.ts`
  `onExit`); an AI agent's (`tracked`), any code, leaves it with its screen and *press Enter to start it again* (a
  resume; the tab bar dims it, ✓), unless the daemon ended it: closing, archiving and shutdown drop the session from `sessions`
  first, restarting replaces it.

### Sleep

`core.ts` `sleepTick`: an idle claude or codex tab (`sleepy`: `cantSleep` says nothing, no attached client, idle
`settings.sleepAfter` minutes by `idleAt` (set in `view` like `runAt`; not the last output: a TUI may redraw); not on a host, not in a workspace with a PR switch on, none of the workspace's
listening ports (`procs`) in its tree) is put to sleep: `asleep` (in memory) and `Session.end`, which SIGHUPs the job
(SIGKILL 5 s later if it's still there) but keeps the screen, the clients and a note instead of the exit line; `onExit`
leaves it be. Its view is `idle`, `asleep: true` (the tab bar dims it, its tooltip says so); `onExit` ignores a session no longer in `sessions` (replaced or dropped). `wake` (an attach in `main.ts`, any `input` but xterm's own focus and mouse reports (`REPORTS`; the key is
dropped), `send`, `tabWake`) is `spawnTab` `resume`, status running (so `send` queues; `sweepRunning` ends it once
quiet and delivers), the ● kept. Enter's restart of an ended agent with a queue sets running too, for the same delivery. `agentOf` and scheduled
runs count an asleep tab as live. A replaced session's `kill` sends its clients `exit` with code -1, which `Term.tsx`
takes as "attach again" (a wake, Enter on an ended agent).

### Terminal queries

Queries (DA, DSR/CPR, DECRQM, DECRQSS, XTVERSION, OSC color) are answered exactly once.

- The newest attached client is the *responder*.
- Other renderers swallow those queries through xterm.js parser hooks (`Term.tsx`).
- With no client attached, the headless terminal answers.

### Agents and hooks

Commands run as `$SHELL -lic '<cmd>'`. The environment adds:
- `TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor`, `LAKI_APP=true`;
- an agent's `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1` (claude's links as OSC 8; an env may say 0; not shells': piped output would get
  them): `Session` snapshots keep them (`keepLinks`: the serialize addon drops them);
- `LAKI_WORKSPACE`, `LAKI_TAB`, `PORT`;
- `LAKI_STORAGE_FOLDER` (`storageOf`; `STORAGE_NOTE`, the start note's and the laki skill's words: files, and a
  `<title>.url` Internet shortcut for each thing an agent publishes, read by `urlOf`): the workspace's own folder for what its agents keep for you, `<settings.storageDir
  or <data>/storage>/<name>-<id>`, named and made at its first tab, kept as `ws.storage` (a rename doesn't move it); none
  for Terminals, Browsers and hosts. `wsRm` and `projectRm` delete it (`rmStorage`: only a `…<id>` folder) unless `settings.keepStorage`; archive keeps it.

Claude and Codex are told about Laki at every start (`LAKI_NOTE`, unless the preset's `laki` is false; then
`PROGRESS_NOTE` with `settings.progress`; one text through `--append-system-prompt` / `-c developer_instructions`, not when
the preset's args set their own, nor for codex when its `config.toml` has `developer_instructions` (`codexOwn`: `-c` would
replace them), not on a host): what Laki is, `laki rename .`, `laki pr .`, `laki new .`, `laki browser`,
`$LAKI_STORAGE_FOLDER` (`STORAGE_NOTE`: files, and a link to what it publishes). The CLI's `rename`/`pr` take `.` for `$LAKI_WORKSPACE` (`wsSet` name, `prAttach`).

Claude gets `--settings <data>/claude-settings.json` and, on this Mac (not a host: no laki CLI there), `--plugin-dir
<data>/claude-plugin` (`claudePlugin`, written by `writeHooks`): a plugin named laki whose `commands/new.md` is
`/laki:new <task> [with <agent>]`, a new workspace in this project through `laki new .` (the CLI's `.`: the project of
`$LAKI_WORKSPACE`'s workspace; `allowed-tools` lets it run only that `laki new` unasked); the laki skill's SKILL.md says the same for the other agents. Its hooks run `laki hook <state>`, using an absolute
node/Electron path and the CLI's path, and map to states:

| hook | state |
|---|---|
| SessionStart | records the resume id |
| UserPromptSubmit, Pre/PostToolUse | running |
| Notification (permission prompts) | waiting |
| Stop | idle, plus the last answer, then delivers the next queued message |
| StopFailure | usage limit (`limits.ts`) |

Codex gets `-c notify=[…,"hook","done"]`, which reports the thread id and the end of a turn.

The other agents (`AGENTS` in `shared/types.ts`: the command is the id; `presets()` defaults to claude, codex and
those on PATH):
- **Gemini**: `gemini -i <prompt>` (0.4.1 answers a bare prompt and exits), `--resume <id>`. Hooks (versions that
  have them, in a folder Gemini trusts) in `<data>/gemini-settings.json`, given as `GEMINI_CLI_SYSTEM_DEFAULTS_PATH`
  (the lowest layer; hook lists add up with the user's): SessionStart (session_id), BeforeAgent/AfterTool (running),
  Notification (waiting), AfterAgent (idle, `prompt_response`); each prints `{}` (gemini wants JSON back). Superset
  puts the same hooks in `~/.gemini/settings.json`; Laki may not. Laki doesn't trust folders for it.
- **OpenCode**: `opencode --prompt <p>`, `--session <id>`. `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR=<data>/opencode` (on top of the
  user's config) loads `plugin/laki.js` (`OPENCODE_PLUGIN`): session.created (not a subagent's: `parentID`) →
  start, session.status busy/idle (idle with the last answer, from `client.session.messages`),
  permission.asked/question.asked → waiting, session.error → failed (an Esc's `MessageAbortedError`: interrupted), and
  the idle after either says nothing; reports go one at a time, in order.
- **Grok**: `grok --session-id <uuid> <prompt>`: Laki picks the chat's id, `--resume <id>` after. Its TUI takes hooks
  only from `~/.grok` (or `~/.claude/settings.json`), so it has none: Enter or a prompt sets running; `sweepRunning`
  reads its window title (`Session.title`: `BUSY` while it works, `ASKS` "Action Required": waiting) and ends the
  turn after `QUIET` with no `BUSY` text, as a hook would (a done notification; a turn started by Enter only after 8s, `Runtime.since`: likely a menu). Gemini without
  hooks too (`Runtime.hooked`: a hook came from the tab; `turn` is `hook` without marking it).

### Projects

A project is a git repository (its top level) or any other folder (`git: false`: local workspaces only,
no branches, diff, PRs or ship). New worktrees go to `worktreesOf`: the project's `config.worktrees` (the app's only; relative: to the repo),
else `settings.worktrees` (`~` is home) with a folder per project, else `<data>/worktrees/<project>`; a host's stay in
`~/.laki-host`. Made ones keep their path. `config` (setup, run, teardown, expose), set in the app, wins field by field over
the repo's `.laki.json` (`projectConfig`).

### SSH hosts

A project with `host` (`projectAdd` `host:path`, `REMOTE` in `shared/types.ts`: a `~/.ssh/config` name or
`user@host`; `hostProjectAdd`) is a folder on that machine; its workspaces copy `host`. `core.ts`' SSH hosts section:

- One connection per host (`hostUp`, `connect`): a ControlMaster the daemon spawns (`-M -N`, socket at
  `<data>/ssh/<hash>`, `BatchMode`: keys or agent, no prompts; a failure stands 10 s), then `$HOME` and the login
  shell's PATH there, then `hostFiles` (heredocs over `sh -s`) puts `~/.laki-host/<mac>/` (`mac()`: the hostname when
  first asked, kept in `<data>/ssh/mac`, since macOS's changes with the network): the `hook` script
  and the agents' hook files (`hookFiles`, as here, their command `<dir>/hook <state>`). Its `exit` drops it: the next
  use connects again. `stopHosts` at shutdown.
- `exec(at, cmd, args)` / `git(at, …)`: here, or `ssh host 'export PATH=…; cd <path> && exec <cmd>'` through the
  master. Every git and gh call takes an `At` (a project or workspace). `sshIn` sends a script or a file on stdin
  (never on a command line: `ps` there shows those). Both go 8 at a time per host (`slot`): sshd takes 10 sessions
  per connection (MaxSessions).
- A tab (`spawnTab` → `hostTab`): its PTY here runs a `/bin/sh` that waits for `<run>/<key>.go` (or prints
  `<key>.err`), then `ssh -tt … 'exec sh ~/.laki-host/<mac>/run/<key>.sh'` on a connection of its own (`TAB_SSH`:
  not the master's sessions; `spaced`: 300 ms apart per host, sshd's MaxStartups drops handshakes past 10). Meanwhile the daemon puts that script
  there: `rm -f "$0"`, `LAKI_TTY=$(tty)`, the folder, `lakiEnv` exported (with `LAKI_HOOK`, a key per start), then
  `exec "$SHELL" -lic <cmd>`. A shell that loses its connection (255) stays; Enter starts it again, like an agent.
- Hooks: the host's `hook` prints `OSC 7717 ; <key> ; <state> ; <base64 JSON> BEL` to `$LAKI_TTY`; the Session's
  headless terminal (`onHook`) hands it to `hook()` when the key is this start's (`running` sends `{}`: PreToolUse's
  payload holds whole files). Nothing listens on the host, and nothing there reaches the daemon.
- `forward`: each live workspace's `$PORT` (`ssh -O forward -L port:localhost:port`) when the host connects and in
  `wsNew`/`wsRestore`; cancelled in `teardown`.
- `.laki.json` there: `hostCfg` (null: none), read by `readHostCfg`/`readHostCfgs` (project add, `wsNew`, `wsRestore`,
  a tab's start when not read yet, each PR scan: `hostSync`, which also follows the branch); `projectConfig` reads the
  cache. `wsArchive` needs the host up (teardown there would fail quietly); `diff` gets new files' diffs in one call.
- `toHost` copies the images a prompt or `send` names (`<data>/images/…`) to the host and rewrites their paths
  (`textFor`, `typeInto` takes a promise). `files`, `fileRead` (`hostFileRead`: base64), `fileNew`, `diff`, stats run
  there; `openIn` opens `vscode|cursor|windsurf://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+<host><path>`, other apps refuse.
- Not there (ponytail): `copyIncludes`, port scans (`scanPorts` sees none), new files' lines in `stat`, a local
  workspace's branch sync, the agent skill. Tested with `test/fakes/ssh` (every host is this machine; `nohost`
  refuses) in `test/ssh.test.ts`.

### Presets

`settings.presets` (default: plain `claude` and `codex`) say how agents start: `agent` (claude, codex,
command), `args` (appended raw before the prompt), `cmd`, `env`, `laki` (false: no `LAKI_NOTE`; Settings' *Tell it about Laki*, claude and codex), `off` (Settings' switch: out of the renderer's
pickers, the new-tab menu, the new-workspace page and its races, scheduled tasks; the daemon still starts it). A tab keeps `preset` = what the agent is
(hooks, resume, colors) and `profile` = the preset's name, looked up at every start (`presetOf`), so edits
apply on restart. Env order: process < `settings.env` (global) < project (`.laki.json`, then the app's) <
preset < Laki's own vars.

A tab's `model` and `effort` (`wsNew`, `tabNew`, kept by `wsFork`; `modelCheck` before a worktree is made: a name, an
effort of `EFFORTS`) become flags at every start (`agentCmd`): claude `--model`/`--effort`, codex `-m` and `-c
model_reasoning_effort="…"`, the others `-m`. `view` gives a running or waiting tab `runAt`, its turn's start (set
there: each change of status comes with `changed()`), for the turn timers (`settings.timers`).

### Interrupts

Esc or ⌃C ends a Claude/Codex turn without any hook. `input` sees the key and `interrupted` checks the
screen for "Interrupted" a few times over 2.5s; a `running` hook in between cancels it. A turn can also end
with no hook and no key (a resumed chat's recap): `sweepRunning` (every 2s) sets a running tab idle after 4s
without output when its last 15 lines lack "esc to interrupt" (claude and codex show it, and redraw, while
they work).

### Resume

`state.json` keeps projects, workspaces, tabs and resume ids (`save`: fsync, then rename; `load` copies one that
reads as `state.json.bak`, and moves one that doesn't to `state.json.broken-<ms>`, then loads the `.bak`: never
empty over it). `daemon.log` goes to `daemon.log.1` past 10 MB when a daemon starts. Starting the daemon brings every tab back:
`claude --resume <id>`, `codex resume <id>`. Shells come back with what ran in them: `keepShells`, in `main.ts`'s
`shutdown` before the sessions are killed, gives each local shell tab `again` (state.json): its front program's
folder (`lsof -d cwd`) and `rerun`'s command. An agent resumes and runs: claude by `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`'s
`sessionId` (read only), else `--continue`; codex `resume --last` (its newest chat in that folder). Anything else is
typed, no Enter; a node shim's line is its name again (`node /…/bin/npm run dev` is `npm run dev`). A live Run tab
gets `again` `{ run: true }`, and `restoreAll` keeps it. `restoreAll` starts the shell in that folder, then `bringBack`
types it once the prompt is up (it printed, then 500 ms quiet; 10 s at most) under a dim note. A crash keeps nothing,
and neither does a host.

### Scans

- Shells (`shellTick`, every 2 s): a local shell tab whose terminal's foreground process group (`ps -o pid=,tpgid=`,
  one call for all) isn't the shell's own is `running` in `view` (`busyShells`): the spinner while a command runs, not
  `worked()` (an agent's turn, for review comments) nor notifications. One whose foreground program is an agent
  (`agentRuns`: `ps -o args=`, claude or `node …/codex`) is `shellAgents`: its status off its screen (`askOf`: waiting;
  `BUSY`: running; else idle, `done` if no one looked), the view's `runs`; no notifications.
- Artifacts (`scanArtifacts`, with the port scan): the files in each live workspace's storage folder, hidden files and folders not
  counted, one scan at a time, as `WorkspaceView.artifacts`: the status bar's *Artifacts: n* (a menu: Finder, or *Show here*: panels.tsx
  `ArtifactsBar`, a strip of previews over the status bar from `artifactList` (newest first, 500 at most) and `fileRead`
  `storage` (the folder as the root, `inside`'s checks), a click shows one big, ← → the others), none at 0. Its `.url` files
  (http(s) only) are `WorkspaceView.links` (newest first): the info panel's *links* rows, and first in the gallery,
  where a click opens them in the browser. `keepPublished`, at each turn's end (`turn`'s idle/done/failed), writes
  `<title>.url` for each link the agent published and the folder hasn't (`sameUrl`): its publish tools' (`publishedBy`, from
  claude's PostToolUse payload, buffered as `Runtime.published`: the Artifact tool's publish, not its read/list/asset, or an
  `mcp__` tool named publish/deploy/upload/share: the first https link it returned, named by its `title`/`name`/file) and
  its last answer's (`publishedIn`: `PUBLISHED`'s hosts, claude.ai artifacts, gists, vercel.app, netlify.app, pages.dev,
  github.io…; named by `[text](url)`, else its sentence's words less "I published", else the host).
- Ports: the `ps` process tree of each workspace's tabs, matched against `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -Fpcn`, every 5s
  (`procs`: each port's pid and command, `WorkspaceView.procs`; `.laki.json` `ports`, strings only, as `portNames`).
  `portKill` (the status bar's ✕, after `ask`): that pid, if it still listens there and is yours (uid), gets SIGTERM,
  and SIGKILL 3 s later if `ps`'s uid and start time are the same. First,
  `syncBranches`: each workspace's `branch` follows its folder's HEAD (`headOf` reads the file, no git run; detached
  stays), so an agent's `git checkout -b` moves the PR lookup, status bar, ship and restore with it (a PR only linked
  stays: its branch's own replaces a guessed one once pushed), and scans PRs now.
  A turn's end scans PRs 2 s later too (`prSoon`, at most every 20 s): `gh pr create` shows up without the minute's wait.
- Diff size (`scanStats`, every 10 s, `LAKI_STAT_SCAN_MS`; with `settings.diffStat === true`, off by default, and a race's
  always, for Compare): each live git
  workspace's `git diff --numstat` against `diff`'s base, new files' lines (the first 100, up to 1 MB) and `git status`'s
  count as `stat` (`WorkspaceView.stat`: add, del, files, dirty); one scan at a time.
- PRs: `gh pr view <branch> --json …` (`PR_FIELDS`: title, author, checks list, head commit, base
  branch, review decision, mergeable: `PR.conflict`, the sidebar's ⚠, mergeStateStatus: `PR.ready` (CLEAN or HAS_HOOKS; UNKNOWN: none), size, body, reviews:
  `reviewersOf`'s (each author's last approval or ask for changes) `approved`, `changes` (the PR section's *Approved by*, the hover card, the status bar's tip); `yoursOn`'s `approvedByMe` and `commentedByMe` (someone else's PR: your approval, your comments or reviews with them; `comments` in `PR_FIELDS`), the sidebar's ✓, ✓✓ and 👀 (`settings.prMarks`: `approved`, `mine`, `commented`, unset on; `at`: start, name or end); `mine`: the author is `ghLogin`'s,
  `gh api user` once per host: no avatar, no Approve), every `settings.prScan` minutes
  (`PR_SCAN`, 1; `prTick`, each minute; `LAKI_PR_SCAN_MS`: tests' pace instead); one scan at a time (`scanPRs`), so `autoPR` never sends twice.
  `prRefresh` (the status bar PR's right click, a workspace's *Refresh PR status*) is `scanPRs` now. No PR on the
  branch (and no `prUrl`): `prFromSaid`, the one PR link its agent tabs' last answers name (one, of a repo of `git
  remote -v`; each tried once per workspace, `saidTried`), attached as `prAttach` does, marked `prSaid` (one in `related` never: you
  moved it off); a scheduled run's local workspace's at its
  turn's end (scans skip local ones; the project's lasting local one would keep the first PR named). Each check has `took`, a finished one's seconds (`completedAt` − `startedAt`). The checks are
  `newest`'s: statusCheckRollup keeps a re-run's old run, so each check (workflow and name) counts by its latest
  `startedAt` (none, or Go's zero time: queued, the newest), as `gh pr checks` does. The primary PR: a worktree's guessed
  `prUrl` (`prSaid`: its prompt's, `guessed` in `fromPRLink`, or its agent's; never one attached or asked for with `link`)
  gives way to its branch's own once the branch is on a remote (`onRemote`, `git for-each-ref refs/remotes/*/<branch>`:
  no gh call for a branch nobody pushed), then `gh pr view <branch>`: that one is followed, the other `related` (the
  same PR, as `gh pr checkout` gives: unlinked). Not a local workspace's: the folder's branch isn't its own.
- `autoLand` (merge when green, `wsSet` refuses it where `prAllows(…, 'land')` is false): in `autoPR`, an open PR
  that isn't a draft, `checks` pass, `conflict` false, `review` none or APPROVED, `ready` not false and no agent tab running or with a queue is merged (`merge()`, the
  project's `mergeMethod` or squash, the branch deleted) once per head (`fix.land`; `wsSet` turning it on again clears it
  at the next scan: `retry`);
  a failure is `overToYou`. The app asks once as it's turned on. A project's `land` turned off clears its workspaces' `autoLand` (`projectSet`).
- `autoPR` (workspace `autoFix` / `autoReview` / `autoMerge`, ported from wb's `review.go`): failing CI on a new head
  commit → `prFix('ci')` (`gh pr checks`, `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed`), at most `settings.prTries` in a row
  (`PR_TRIES`, 3), then status waiting and a notification (`overToYou`, once, as the count goes over); conflicts on a new head commit →
  `prFix('conflict')` (merge the base in, push), `fix.merge`/`fix.merges`, the same tries (mergeable UNKNOWN, as after a
  push, keeps the count); `wsSet` turning a switch on again gives its tries back at the next scan (`retry`: a scan under way
  would write its copy of `ws.fix` over a reset made then). New review threads → `reviewMessage`
  (GraphQL `reviewThreads`; `reviewKey` counts yours too, but not the agent's: it comments as you, so yours made while a
  tab of the workspace was running, `busy`/`agentSaid` from `changed()`, ±`SKEW`, are its, their ids kept as `fix.mine`).
  What was sent is `workspace.fix`.
  Messages go to the first live claude/codex tab with `send({ whenIdle })`. Each starts with `prPrompt`: the
  `settings.prPrompts` text for ci, review or conflict, else `PR_PROMPTS` (`shared/types.ts`), `{{pr}}`, `{{url}}`,
  `{{base}}` filled in; the checks' logs or the threads follow. The info panel's send buttons use the same.
- Images pasted into a prompt: `imageSave` writes them to `<data>/images/`; the prompt gets their paths.

### Tunnels

Expose to the world (`core.ts` `tunnelStart`): `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<port>
[--allowed-mail=<m>…]`, a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel; the URL is the first `https://<name>.trycloudflare.com` in its
output that isn't `login.`. No emails: public, anyone with the link (the popup's default). Emails need
cloudflared 2026.9.3+ (`MAIL_VERSION`) and are kept in `settings.tunnelMails`. Tunnels live in the daemon's memory (`tunnels`, in `WorkspaceView.tunnels`): stopped by
`tunnelStop`, a workspace's teardown, and shutdown; a daemon restart ends them. One per workspace and port.

### Remote access

`core.ts` `remoteStart`: the same `cloudflare()` as a tunnel, in front of the daemon itself
(`http://127.0.0.1:<daemon port>`), with one `--allowed-mail` (`ONE_MAIL`: an address, never a
`*@domain`; kept as `settings.remoteMail`), or none only with `open: true` and no mail (Settings asks for *confirm*
typed, in a red box; `view.remote.open`, a red status bar badge: the token is then the only lock), for `REMOTE_HOURS` (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 0: forever, no `until`). Each start makes a
`remoteToken`; `remoteView` (`view.remote`) gives the link, `<url>/?token=<token>` (a query: Cloudflare's email sign-in drops a
hash), which the renderer (`api.ts`: no port) uses on the page's own origin, then takes out of the address bar
(`pageToken`: `replaceState`, kept in the tab's `sessionStorage` `laki.token` for reconnects; Cloudflare's sign-in page,
an earlier history entry, still holds the link). While it runs, `main.ts`
takes the tunnel's URL as an Origin, and that token only with it (a client with no Origin needs the daemon's own);
`remoteStop` drops both, so an old link is dead. The page (`api.ts` `whyNot`), when its socket won't open twice: a
`fetch` of itself that redirects is Cloudflare's sign-in run out (a reload signs in again, once per 30 s), a 401/403 from
`/rpc` is a dead link, no answer or a 5xx is the Mac out of reach; App shows it on the splash and in the status bar
(the `problem` event). Retries back off to 10 s. `page` serves the HTML `no-store`, so a tab brought back or Back
goes through the sign-in instead of loading from the cache with every other request turned away. It ends by
`remoteStop`, at `until` (`remoteTick`, every 15 s), when cloudflared exits, or at shutdown.

`main.ts` `page`: any GET serves a file of the built renderer (`out/renderer`: the folder with `assets`, never the dev
`src/renderer`; or `LAKI_PAGE`) whatever the
Origin: the files hold no secrets. Paths that leave the folder, or don't decode, are 404. The CSP's
`connect-src 'self'` lets the page reach its own daemon over `wss://`.

### Scheduled tasks

`core.ts` `scheduleSet`, `scheduleTick` (every 30 s), `runSchedule`; the rule comes from `shared/when.ts` `parseWhen`
(a line of English to days of the week and minutes after midnight, in the Mac's time zone; `once` for
`once`/`tomorrow`), kept with the text so "tomorrow" means the day it was saved; `nextRun` gives `next`; `stamp` fills `{{DD-MM-YY}}`-style
dates (only braces of date tokens, any of them in any order; `MM` right after an hour is the minutes) in the name and
prompt with the run's time; `fillTemplate` stamps a template's text the same way before its vars (a typed prompt isn't),
and App's `runAction` an action's. A run (ws) makes a new workspace
(`new`: `wsNew` with the preset and prompt; `wsTitle` names it, with the id's random tail when another workspace has that name; the task's `schedule` id marks
it: the sidebar's clock),
or a new session in the project's own folder (`local-new`: `wsNew` `local` + `another`, a local workspace beside the one
it has, so each run is a sidebar row), or uses that folder (`local`: its local workspace, made by the first run) or a workspace
(its id); in those last two, the prompt goes to the
workspace's running agent of that preset (`send` whenIdle), else a new tab with it. Every run, or a missed one (more
than `MISSED_AFTER`, 30 minutes, late: skipped), goes to `state.runs` (the last 200; the view has 50). A tick moves
every due task on before it runs any, so a slow worktree isn't started twice. Removing a project removes its tasks; a
gone or archived workspace is a failed run.

### Laki AI

`daemon/ai.ts` (`settings.ai`, `AiSettings`; off unless `on`): a conversation that works Laki with `cli/mcp.ts`'s
`tools(rpc)`, given the daemon's own `call` (no HTTP), less `laki_progress`: nothing archives, deletes, ships or merges;
with `settings.ai.skill` unset or true, Laki's skill: `cli/mcp.ts` `skillTools` (`laki_ask`, `laki_remove`: `aiQuestion` names it from state, `whatOf`; `aiAnswer` refuses a question with an ask of yours after it,
`laki_prs`, `laki_project`, `laki_notes_write`, `laki_memory_write`, `laki_rename`, `laki_shell`: a command typed with
`enter: false`, never run; `laki_actions`, `laki_templates`, `laki_run_action` (a terminal's command typed likewise; an agent's sent), `laki_schedule_set`, `laki_todo_add`) and
`SKILL` after `SYSTEM` (`system()`), given to `laki mcp` as `LAKI_AI_SKILL=1` for the CLI backends; a turn that asked
(`asked`) ends there on OpenRouter and says no answer of its own; `laki_new_workspace` takes a `template` and an agent
`action` (`promptOf`, `kit`: text.ts' merge rules); `settings.ai.hideCost`: the AI page without money; `settings.ai.context` (Settings › AI › *Your instructions*, `AI_CONTEXT_MAX`): the user's words after `SYSTEM` and `SKILL`, in `system()`;
its extension tools (`laki_extensions`, `laki_extension_guide`: `widgetFormat`, `laki_extension_read`, `laki_extension_write`;
a tool's `max` is what its result may give the model, over `TOOL_TEXT`) make extensions, saved off;
its `laki_send` (MCP's too) is `send` `agent: true`: an agent's tab only, never typed into a question it asks. Only when asked: no watching on its own. One ask at a time (`busy`); `aiStop` aborts the
fetch or kills the CLI. `SYSTEM` tells it what Laki is and to act at once. Backends (`backend`, unset: openrouter):
- `openrouter`: `POST <api>/chat/completions` (`LAKI_AI_API`: tests' fake, localhost only) with the tools as functions
  and `usage: { include: true }` (its `cost`), looping over `tool_calls` up to `steps` rounds (`AI_STEPS`, 20); the
  earlier asks and answers (`history`, 20) go with each ask, not the tools' results. A pasted image (only from
  `<data>/images`, `imageOk`: nothing else of the Mac goes to a model) as a data URL. The key: `<data>/ai-key`, 0600
  (`aiKey`), never in state.json, the view or `aiState` (only whether there is one). Model: `models.openrouter`, else
  `AI_MODEL`;
- `claude`: `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --mcp-config <laki mcp, LAKI_HOME> --strict-mcp-config
  --tools Read --allowedTools mcp__laki --append-system-prompt …`, `--resume` its `session_id` the next time; cost:
  the result's `total_cost_usd`;
- `codex`: `codex exec [resume <thread>] --json --skip-git-repo-check --ignore-user-config (its MCP servers) -c sandbox_mode="read-only"
  -c developer_instructions=… -c mcp_servers.laki.{command,args,env,tool_timeout_sec}`, `-i` per image; no cost.
Chats (`Thread`, `thread(id)`): `''` the AI page's (`<data>/ai-chat.json`), `plan:<project>/<kind>/<slug>` a spec's or
brainstorm's (`shared/plans.ts` `planChat`; `plans.ts` `planOfChat`: its folder's `.chat.json`, which `filesOf` hides and
`planWrite` refuses), each with its messages, `resume` and `at`; `system(t)` names the spec or brainstorm. One ask at a
time in any of them (`busy.id`; another chat's ask: "Laki AI is busy in another chat"); `aiQuestion` goes to the busy
one. A plan's chat unused `PLAN_CHAT_IDLE` (12 hours) is `ended` (`aiTick`, or as it's read again): its ask stopped,
what was said kept; the next ask starts it again empty (`fresh`), `aiContinue` keeps its session. `planRm` drops it
(`aiForget`). The `ai` event carries `of`, the chat's id: an `id` would make it a reply.
Both run in `<data>/ai` with `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` 5 minutes (a `wsNew` takes a while), with Settings' env and, with
`ai.preset` (Settings › AI's *Your agent presets*: a claude or codex preset), that preset's env over it (an account of
its own; its args are a tab's, not used); `resume` is kept per `sessionKey` (the agent and the preset). Each tool call is a `tool`
message, shown in the conversation. `<data>/ai-chat.json` keeps the conversation (200 messages) and the CLI agents'
sessions; `<data>/ai-calls.jsonl` a line per ask (`AiCall`: tokens, cost, tools, ms, ok, error; a failed ask keeps what
it spent; a CLI agent's failure is its own words, not its exit code; shutdown stops an ask, else its `laki mcp`
would start a daemon again), `aiTotals` (shared/types.ts) today's and this month's. Links: `SYSTEM` has it link each
workspace or tab it names (`laki://ws/<id>?tab=<tab>`), and the page links the bold names it didn't (`links.ts`
`linkWorkspaces`); a laki:// link in any Markdown goes to App's router (`api.ts` `onLakiLink`), or, in a window
without one (the AI window), to main's `open-external`, which shows the app window and routes it (`openLink`). The renderer's `Ai.tsx` (`AiPage`: the rail's AI
when on, ⌘K, `laki://ai`; Chat, Calls and Info tabs; the chat Claude's way: examples, the thread in a column, a turn's tool
calls folded into one `.ai-tools` pill (each line's *Open*: its `ws` or `target`), `PromptInput` `enter` (⏎ asks) with images and dictation, Stop, New chat; Info
`.ai-info`: how it runs and pays (`PAYS`, `SESSION`), spending, what it can do; the bubbles' *Ask
Laki AI*: main's `aiWin`, `?window=ai`, `NewWindow.tsx` `AiWindow`: `AiPage` `compact`, `.ai-window`: its own head
(`.ai-win-head`, the drag region: New chat, ✕; Esc closes) over the chat alone, no Calls, Info, cost or foot) and Settings › AI (`AiSection`: on, backend, model, the key, steps, spending). The CLI's `laki ai`. Tested in
`test/ai.test.ts` (a fake OpenRouter; the fake claude's `-p` and codex's `exec`, which call `laki mcp` through
`test/fakes/mcp.cjs`).

### Specs & Brainstorms

Experimental (`settings.specs`, Settings › General › *Experimental*; off: no rail button, foot button, ⌘K item, project
tab or Spec picker, and the daemon's `plan*` methods and `GET /plan/` refuse). `daemon/plans.ts`: a folder each, outside
the repo and its worktrees, `<data>/plans/<project>/specs|brainstorms/<slug>/` (the project's folder: `Project.plans`,
`<name>-<id>` or `<id>`, made with the first; kept when the project goes): `spec.json` (`{ title, blocks }`, BlockNote's),
`README.md` (`# title` and the blocks as Markdown, `specmd.ts` `blocksToMarkdown`, headings a level down; what agents
read), `files/` (pasted and dropped files, a diagram's PNG: `planUpload`) and anything else (a brainstorm's output).
`planGet`'s `outside`: README.md newer than spec.json by a second, or no spec.json (a new one: `planNew` writes only
README.md, its title and `text`: a template's (`settings.planTemplates`, unset: `PLAN_TEMPLATES`, Feature and Idea) or
none, empty); the page then loads README.md (`readmeBody`, `tryParseMarkdownToBlocks`), or asks
*Load it* / *Keep mine* when there's a doc. `inside` keeps paths in the folder, links followed. `GET /plan/<project>/<kind>/<slug>/<file>.html?key=<widgetKey>`
(`planPage`): a prototype with a JS widget page's CSP (sandboxed, inline scripts and styles, Google Fonts, data:/https
images; nothing out).

The renderer's `Specs.tsx` (`SpecsPage`, App's `lazy` import with its `SpecEditor.tsx`, `diagram.tsx` and `plans.css`:
BlockNote, Mantine and React Flow load only as it opens; dialog `{ specs: <project or ''>, kind?, slug? }`; the rail's
*Specs* after Schedule, the foot's without the rail, ⌘K, a project page's *Specs* tab (`ProjectApi.specs`)): three
levels as breadcrumbs in `Page`'s header (`head`; its `tools`: the app's full screen, `toggleFull`): the index (both kinds'
newest, `ON_INDEX`, a filter, a project, *New spec* / *New brainstorm*), a kind's whole list (refreshed every 5 s while
shown), and the open one alone, 1100px at most: its title (the last crumb, `onTitle`), the editor (saved 600 ms after a
change and as it closes; a title change saves what the editor holds, `onReady`), its files (`OutFile`: `.md` through
`Markdown` (mermaid too), `.html` in an iframe `sandbox="allow-scripts"` from `GET /plan/`, `.diagram.json`
(`normalizeDiagram`) through `DiagramView`, images, text), *Start* (a spec: App's new-workspace page, `specPrompt`) or
*Brainstorm with Laki AI* (`aiAsk` with `brainstormPrompt` in its own chat, `shared/plans.ts`; the files every 2 s
meanwhile; Laki AI off: Settings › AI). A brainstorm's chat is `PlanChat`, a panel on its right (`.plan.with-chat`, its
toggle kept as `laki.planChat`; mounted while hidden, so its ask is followed; Ai.tsx's `Message`, `Tools`, `turns`):
*New chat*, Stop, an ended one's *Continue it*. New ▾ (`fromTemplate`) starts one from a template; the index's
*Templates* is a level of its own (`Templates`: name, kind, Markdown, saved 500 ms after typing through `settingsSet`
`planTemplates`; *The ones Laki comes with*). `SpecEditor.tsx` is specdrop's `web/editor.tsx` (the diagram block, its slash items, files pasted and
dropped; `resolveFileUrl` turns `files/…` into data URLs); `diagram.tsx` is specdrop's `web/diagram.tsx` as it is (its
styles in `plans.css`, specdrop's tokens as `--sd-*` from the theme's); `useEscape` keeps Esc in a modal from closing the
page. The new-workspace page's *Spec* picker (`planList` of its project) adds `Spec: <path>/README.md` to the prompt.
MCP's `laki_plans`, `laki_plan_read`, `laki_plan_new`, `laki_plan_write` (`BRAINSTORM_OUTPUT`: what to write). Tested in
`test/plans.test.ts`.

### MCP

`src/cli/mcp.ts`, `laki mcp`: JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, a message per line (`initialize` echoes the client's
protocol version; `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `ping`; notifications get no answer, other methods -32601). Each tool is
one or two `rpc` calls (`tools(rpc)`: Laki AI passes the daemon's own); none deletes, archives or ships. Its `state` (also `laki ls --json`, which the skill has agents
run) leaves out settings, projects' config, queued prompts and remote access's link: an agent's transcript keeps them. stdout is the protocol's, so the daemon starts at the first
tool call (`ensureDaemon`), never before. `state` gives each project's `groups` (its seps' names) and each workspace's
`group` (the sep above it, `rowsOf`); `laki_new_workspace` `group` (a name, any case, or an id: `groupId`, refused
when there's none of it) is `wsNew` `place`, and Laki AI's `SYSTEM` has it pick the group that fits. Each workspace's
`related` and `from` too; `laki_new_workspace` `link` is `wsNew`'s, and `tools(rpc, from)`'s `from` (the CLI's
`$LAKI_WORKSPACE`; the daemon drops its own at start, so Laki AI's have none) its `from`. Tested in `test/cli.test.ts`.

### Links

`laki://` (electron-builder's `protocols`, `setAsDefaultProtocolClient` when packaged): main's `open-url` queues a
link until the renderer says `deep-link-ready` (preload's `onDeepLink`; a main-frame navigation resets it), then
sends `deep-link`. `links.ts` `parseLink` (tested in `test/links.test.ts`), App routes it once the view is in: a
workspace or tab, the new-workspace page filled in (`initial`), Scheduled tasks, the Board, Settings, Help, About, Get started (`onboard`: the Help menu's *Get Started Again…*). Links select and fill
in; they never create or run anything.

### Preview

The side panel's Preview: a `<webview>` (`webviewTag`) made by hand in `SidePanel.tsx` `PreviewTab`. Its address bar
is `text.ts` `previewUrl` (a path on the port, `:5173`, `localhost:…`, a site, a URL) and `previewAddr`; a size
(`SIZES`, `parseSize`, the devices bar) gives `.web-host` that width and height and `transform: scale()` down to
`.web-body`. Main's
`will-attach-webview` drops any preload, forces no node, sandbox and context isolation, and refuses a `src` that
isn't `http://localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (the first page; after it, the address bar and links go to any website: `go`'s
`SITE`, a bare `example.com`, is https), or a partition other than `persist:preview`, whose session grants only
`PREVIEW_OK` permissions (Electron grants all by default). No `allowpopups`: its popups are blocked. `capture` (IPC) takes a webview of the
asking window by its `webContentsId` and returns a PNG (base64); `ShotBox` saves it (`imageSave`) and sends its path to
the agent. The crosshair (`pick`, the app only) runs `pickElement`'s source in the page (`executeJavaScript`): it
outlines what's under the mouse and resolves the clicked element (a short unique CSS selector, its opening tag, text,
size, its outerHTML up to 1,500 characters, the computed CSS of `CSS_KEYS` that isn't a default, its rect and the
page's width, the URL), or null on Esc (`window.__lakiPick(null)` cancels it from outside); the app then captures the
webview and `crop`s it to the element (a canvas, scaled by the image's width over the page's), saves it, and
`PanelApi.toPrompt` types all of it, with the screenshot's path, into the focused agent tab, else the first live one
(`send` `enter: false`: no Enter, no turn). In a browser on the Mac it's an iframe (the CSP's `frame-src`); elsewhere, a note.

A Browsers workspace's page (`Browser.tsx` `BrowserPane`, over `.term-wrap` in place of the terminals; App's `browsed`:
ones opened since start stay mounted, `visibility: hidden`) is a `<webview>` in `persist:browser`: main's
`will-attach-webview` lets it start on any http(s) page, `did-attach-webview` turns a link to a new tab into a load in
place and gives a `window.open` popup (`disposition` new-window: a sign-in's) a small sandboxed window in the same
session, its opener kept (`allowpopups` plus `setWindowOpenHandler`), a link to a new tab (`disposition` background-tab: a middle click or ⌘-click, or the menu's *Open Link in New Tab*;
foreground-tab: target=_blank, selected) goes to the app as `browser-tab` (preload's `onBrowserTab`), App's `quickNew`
with its `url`: a Browsers workspace of its own, named by its host until its title (⌘T or the tab bar's + there: an
empty one; ⌘W: App's `closePage`, `wsRm` at once, the next one of the project selected, Undo a `quickNew` of its URL;
from inside the page, main's `before-input-event` takes ⌘W and ⌘T from it and sends `browser-key`, preload's
`onBrowserKey`, App's keys as if typed there); a right click is main's `pageMenu` (link, image, selection or field, back, forward, reload, Inspect Element: `inspectElement`; the toolbar's `</>`: the webview's `openDevTools`), its session gets `PREVIEW_OK` permissions only and Chrome's user
agent without Laki's and Electron's names. `text.ts` `browserUrl` reads the address bar (a URL, a site, else a
DuckDuckGo search).

The agent browser (`browse` above) is main's: a hidden `BrowserWindow` per workspace (1280×800, the preview's
partition, sandboxed, no popups, navigation and redirects kept to local URLs), destroyed after 10 idle minutes;
click and fill run in the page (`pageJs`: the first match, scrolled into view; fill sets the value through the
native setter and fires input and change), then wait 300 ms.

### Widgets

`daemon/widgets.ts` (the SDK for people: `docs/extensions.md`): a widget is a folder with `widget.json` (`Manifest`: name, `place` (`WIDGET_PLACES`: side, top,
status; the store's wins, `placeOf`), size in cells (down 1–4 or 0.5: half a cell, `down`; the grid's
rows are half cells, `span size*2`), `every` minutes,
`view` (the full view's dialog: `s`, `m`, `l`, `WidgetSize`; `.modal.widget-modal.<size>`), `config` (each setting a
default or a `Spec`: `type` text, number, bool, choice, list, `label`, `hint`, `choices`; `optionsOf` gives the view's
`options`), `fetch` (a shell command) or `script` (a JS file run by Laki's node through `RUN_JS`: its default export
gets `{ config, last }`; what it throws goes to stderr as its message alone, and `lastLine` skips node's own
trailer), `actions`) and `widget.html`. A setting is kept and given to a fetch as text (`textOf`: a bool `1` or empty,
a list deduped and joined by commas; `configOf`, the view's `config`), and to a page or a script typed (`typedOf`: a boolean, a
number or null, an array). `scanWidgets` reads `widgetRoots()` (`<data>/widgets`,
`settings.widgetDirs`, then the repo's `widgets/`, `BUILTIN`, off until turned on; the first of an id wins) at start,
on `widgetReload` and when `widgetDirs` changes; only that list stays in memory. Each widget's storage,
`<data>/widget-data/<id>.json` (`Store`): the user's on, size, every, view, config and the last fetch's `data`, `at`, `error`.
`exec` runs a fetch or an action (`/bin/sh -c`: the widget's own scripts in any language, `python3 fetch.py`; the
guide says so) in the widget's folder with `$WIDGET_<NAME>` per setting, `$LAKI_WIDGET_CONFIG`,
`$LAKI_WIDGET_FILE`, `$LAKI_CLI` (`launcher`: `<data>/widget-data/laki`) and an action's `$WIDGET_ARG` (never in the
command); stdout must be JSON; a failure keeps the last data. `widgetTick` (30 s, and as the first client connects)
fetches what's due, only while a client is on the socket (the app is open) and within `settings.widgetHours` (`when.ts`
`parseHours`/`inHours`: `9am-9pm weekdays`, `no weekends`, overnight spans; a line that doesn't read: always). An action that prints
JSON (all of stdout, or its last line) with `toast`/`modal` (`shared/widget.ts` `sayOf`: up to 4 buttons, each `run` (an action, `arg`), `open` (http(s),
mailto, laki://) or nothing) returns them; a JS page's `laki.toast`/`laki.modal` post the same (`say`). The renderer
shows a busy toast while an action runs (the button `data-busy`, cleared by a `done` message to the frame), then the
result: App's `widgetApi.say`, a modal through ui.tsx's `choose` (the `ask` dialog with any buttons).

`shared/widget.ts`: the template language (`render`: `{{a.b}}` escaped, `#each`/`#if`/`#unless` with `else`, `date`,
`ago`, `spark`), `viewOf` (`<template preview>` / `<template full>`), `WIDGET_CSS` and `pageOf`. A widget whose HTML
has a `<script>` (`js`) is a page the daemon serves at `GET /widget/<id>?key=<widgetKey>` with a CSP of `sandbox
allow-scripts; default-src 'none'` (no network, an opaque origin), the theme's variables from its `theme` query,
`window.laki` and a click bridge that posts `open`, `refresh`, `full` and `run` to the app; the store's `net` (Settings'
*Network access*, a JS widget's only, never widget.json's) adds `connect-src https:` and https images and fonts (`netOf`). The renderer's
`Widgets.tsx`: `WidgetStrip` (`place` top: the tab bar after its spacer; status: the status bar's end; each `Cell` as wide
as its cells across, `--widget-cell`, a line high), `WidgetGrid` (the sidebar's, `place` side or none: plain values, no tiles, no head; a line between widgets: each `.widget` draws its left and top border over its neighbour's, the grid clips the outer ones), `WidgetDialog` (the full view), `WidgetBody`
(a template widget in a shadow root after `clean`, the sanitizer: no scripts, frames, forms, `on…` attributes or
non-http links; a JS one in an iframe `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, whose messages count only from its own window);
Settings' `WidgetsSection` (the app's word is *Extensions*; the files, ids, CLI and skill keep *widget*; `WidgetList`:
Scheduled tasks' `.sched-row`s, each with its switch, a click opens its `WidgetCard` in panels.tsx' `Modal`, whose
close blurs the field first (text and numbers save on blur), and Settings' Esc leaves it to an open `.overlay`; `WidgetPrompt`: `shared/widgetGuide.ts` `widgetPrompt`, the format as a prompt for any AI
chat, which the laki-widget skill's SKILL.md shares as `widgetFormat`; `WidgetCard`: a head row, then
`WidgetOptionField` per setting, a list's `ChipsInput`; its folder button is App's Open in menu with `widget`). The
ones that come with Laki: `widgets/links` (a JS page: each `links` chip `Label: url`, plain words with a rule between them, opened in the
browser; no fetch; 3×½),
`widgets/my-prs` (shell, gh `--jq`: an author's open PRs (`@me`, empty too) as `stats`, open,
drafts, conflicts and `label1`–`label3`'s counts, and `groups`, each PR in the first of conflict, failing CI, changes,
approved, in review, a draft first of all; a template) and
`widgets/team-prs` (a JS fetch, a `gh pr list --author` per login at once: the whole list with its checks is a 504 in
a busy repo, and gh's search ANDs authors; a JS page: an author select, a click on a name too; its `review` action:
`laki new <project> --pr` with `prompt`, or `command` (`sh -c`, `$PR`, `$PR_NUMBER`), the button named `button`), are tested on the fake gh's `pr list` (`$FAKE_GH/prlist.json`,
`--author` and `--jq` applied with the real jq) in `test/widget.test.ts`. The browser pane doesn't paint cross-origin frames: check a JS
widget's page in Chrome (headless `--screenshot`).

### Notifications

The renderer posts them (`turn` events, App.tsx): off when `settings.notify === false`, per kind
`settings.notifyOn[waiting|done|limit] === false`, or a muted workspace or tab (`muted`, ⋯ and right-click menus).
`settings.notifySound` (a macOS sound's name, `none`, unset: the default) goes to main's `Notification`. A waiting
turn is posted 800 ms later (its menu is often drawn after the hook; none if it isn't waiting by then), with an action
per choice of the tab's `ask` (`NotifyAction`: `n` and `label`, main calls `answer` with both), else, when its text
says "permission", *Allow* / *Deny* (`pick` first / last).

Phone pushes are the daemon's (`push.ts`, `core.ts` `phone`), so they go with the app closed: `settings.webhook` (`url`,
`format` ntfy/slack/telegram/json, `waiting` unset on, `done` unset off) on a `turn` that waits or is done, and on
`overToYou`; once per state change of a tab (`pushed`, cleared when `view()` sees it running), never muted. A wait goes 800 ms
later with `askOf`'s choices as lines (JSON: `options`); with `webhook.answer` (Settings' *Answer from the phone*,
off by default) a `nonce` per push: Telegram's `inline_keyboard` (`callback_data` `nonce:n`) and ntfy's JSON publish
to the server's root with `http` actions (3 at most) posting `nonce:n` to `ntfyReplies` (`<topic URL>-<replyTopic>`,
the random part Settings makes). `awaiting` keeps each nonce with the tab and its choices; while any is there,
`phoneTick` (every 5 s; the API's for tests) runs `push.ts` `replies` (Telegram's `getUpdates` from `tapCursor`, only
callback queries from the URL's `chat_id`, each acknowledged; ntfy's `/json?poll=1&since=`) and answers a tap whose
nonce is waiting and whose tab still shows the same choices (`answer` with `label`); a nonce goes as it's used, when
its tab stops waiting, or after a day; none left: the timer stops. ntfy gets a
`Title` header (RFC 2047 past ASCII) and the question as the body; Slack its text escaped; JSON `{event, workspace, tab,
agent, message, ts}`. `https://` only (plain `http://` to localhost: tests' server; Settings flags another). 5 s timeout, a failure logged. `webhookTest` is Settings' *Send test* (answered, not logged).

Archive on merge (`archiveMerged`, after `autoPR` in `scanPR`; `settings.archiveMerged`, off by default): a worktree
whose PR is MERGED, with no tracked tab other than idle, `rev-list <head>..HEAD` 0 and `wsArchive` `ifClean`; once per
PR (`autoArchived`: an Undo stays). It broadcasts `archived`, which App toasts with Undo (`wsRestore`); a merged PR's
row says *merged* while the setting is on.

### Usage

Plan limits (`usage.ts`, the renderer's `Usage.tsx`): `usage` reads Claude's `GET api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`
(`Authorization: Bearer` + `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`; the token is the freshest of `security
find-generic-password [-a $USER] -s "Claude Code-credentials" -w` and `~/.claude/.credentials.json`) and Codex's `GET
chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` (`$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` `tokens`, `chatgpt-account-id`). Tokens are read-only:
never refreshed (that can sign the agent out), an expired one isn't sent. Each agent's answer is kept 5 minutes
(`USAGE_TTL`: Anthropic turns away faster pollers; a 429 or a turned-away token too), one that asked no server or failed on the way 1
(`AGAIN`); `settings.usage[agent] === false` skips it. The renderer asks every minute. Tests set `LAKI_USAGE_API`
(a fake server for both; only `http://127.0.0.1` or `localhost` count: a session's env can reach a daemon the CLI starts) and get a fake `security`
(`test/fakes`) reading `$HOME/keychain`: never the real Keychain.

### Renderer

`src/renderer/src`:

- **`App.tsx`**: the sidebar, tab bar, toolbar, send bar, palette items and keys.
  - Keys are handled in a capture-phase `keydown` through the `act` map; xterm never sees ⌘ keys. ⌘⇧N clicks the tab
    bar's + (`.newtab-btn`): a menu opened by a key's click (`detail` 0) has its first item picked (`Menu` `first`).
    ⌘⇧A is `toggleArtifacts` (the status bar's Artifacts strip, `gallery`); ⌘L is Send later (`canLater`); ⌘⇧⏎ is
    `toggleFull` (the tab bar's ⤢): `.app.full` hides the chrome (styles.css), `.full-exit` brings it back, and main's
    `full-screen` IPC puts the window full screen (`focusFull`: whether it was, restored after, and what `saveWin` keeps).
  - Per-viewer UI state is in `localStorage`:
    - `laki.ws`: the selected workspace;
    - `laki.tabs`: the selected tab per workspace;
    - `laki.groups`: each workspace's tabs, each a split tree of sessions;
    - `laki.side`: the sidebar width; `laki.sideOpen`: whether it's shown; `laki.info`: the workspaces whose info panel is open (⌘I, per workspace);
    - `laki.rail`: the rail layout's kind (`RailKind`: projects, shells, browsers);
    - `laki.folded`: the projects whose workspaces the sidebar hides (a click on the project's head; `rows.dragged`
      keeps a drag's click from folding it), and the seps whose workspaces up to the next sep it hides (`shownRows`);
    - `laki.panel`, `laki.panelTab`, `laki.panelW`: the right panel; `laki.infoW`: the info panel's width (both
      `Panes.tsx` `PanelHandle`);
    - `laki.theme`: the last `Paint` (theme, glass, font), painted before the daemon's settings arrive.
    - `laki.active`: when each agent tab last worked or waited (ms), for the bubbles' recent ones; closed tabs drop out.
    - `laki.runsSeen`: the newest run the Scheduled tasks page showed (the clock's dot: a failed one after it).
    - `laki.recent`: the palette's last 30 picks, by label: first in it, and ahead of a close match.
    - `laki.md`: the file preview's Markdown mode, `raw` or `rendered`.
    - `laki.video`: the sidebar's video (an embed URL), back after a reload without autoplay.
    - `laki.timers`: the sidebar's timers (`id`, `end`, `ms`, `then`, `left`: paused, its ms left, kept as it is;
      `note`: its message, Go out: on its bar, the end dialog's title, the notification's); ones that ended while the
      app was closed are dropped.
      Send later (⌘L, the toolbar's clock and ⋯, a tab's right click, ⌘K, the AI page's clock (`onLater`, dialog `back`);
      `SendLaterDialog` in panels.tsx, `text.ts` `parseLater`: a length or a time of day; `picks`: Run ▾'s agent actions,
      `mergeActions`) is one with `then: 'send'`, `ws`, `tab`, `text`: `send` `whenIdle` as it rings (Send now, Edit,
      Cancel in its menu); `tab: 'ai'` is Laki AI (`askLater`: `aiAsk` with the text stamped, tried every 15 s for an hour
      while it's busy, a notification as it answers); one due while the app was closed is dropped with a toast (`missed`).
    - `laki.watches`: the stopwatches (the timer menu's *Stopwatch*, `StopwatchBar` in panels.tsx): `ms` counted before,
      `from` running since.
      A reminder (a workspace's *Remind me…*, `RemindDialog`) is one with `then: 'remind'` and `ws`: it notifies about
      the workspace (the click: its first tab) and toasts *Open*; one due while the app was closed rings as it opens.
    - `laki.previewSize`: Preview's size (`{ w, h }`, null: the panel's).
    - `laki.branchFull`: the status bar's branch (`.sb-branch`) whole, with its base; else short: no branch prefix, cut at 24ch, all of it in the tip.
    - `laki.newDraft`: the new-workspace page's draft (`Draft`: the form, images, race, template), saved as it changes
      while something's typed, dropped as it's made (back if that fails) or *Clear*ed; `laki.scheduleDraft`: Scheduled
      tasks' open form (Cancel asks when it changed); `laki.settingsSec`: Settings' last section. Their forms don't
      submit on Enter (`onSubmit` prevents it; ⌘⏎ or the button), and `Page`'s and `Modal`'s Esc is `escapes` (not one
      a menu or field took, nor an IME's); a `Modal` with something typed in it nods at a click outside instead of closing
      (`loose`: the palette closes anyway).
    - `laki.onboard`: Get started (`panels.tsx` `Onboarding`, `STEPS`): `done` (ticked, or seen done by App's
      `onboardDone`: a project, a workspace, Settings' sections through `SettingsPage` `onSection`, Shells or Browsers),
      `seen` (it opened once by itself), `off` (Don't show again: no `OnboardBar` at the sidebar's foot either).
    - `laki.newWs`: the new-workspace page's last choices (`LastNew`: project, preset, cmd, local, model, effort,
      base, place (that project's), template name, and Settings' default agent then: a new default wins; never the prompt, name, PR or a race); its More starts closed.
  - The Dock's count (`bridge.badge`, main's `app.dock.setBadge`): tabs waiting, or done unseen, outside muted tabs,
    muted and archived workspaces. The same message carries the menu bar's item (`badge(n, items, tray)`: main's
    `Tray`, `trayIcon` drawn in code as a template image; the count as its title, a menu of those tabs, waiting first
    with what they ask from `turn` events, `show(tab)` on a click, then *New Workspace…* (`newWsWin`) and the screenshots; `settings.menuBar === false` destroys it). `TurnTime` (`ui.tsx`'s `Elapsed`, ticking each second) on a tab and a row, with
    `settings.timers`.
  - The theme is applied during render (`applyTheme`), before the terminals' effects read the CSS. Glass also
    goes to main (`bridge.glass`: `setVibrancy`) when it changes.
  - The toolbar's ⋯ (`wsActions`) has *Copy path* (the full one, `host:` first; `shortPath`'d as its hint); the status
    bar has no path. A Terminals workspace's leaves out `$PORT` (its listening ports as any), a Browsers one has no status bar (unless
    the daemon is stale or the connection is down).
  - Resting on a row (`peek`, 550 ms; 120 ms once one shows) shows `peekCard` beside the sidebar instead of a
    tooltip: state and agents, the last answer or the ask, the PR (avatar, state, title, author, checks, review,
    conflicts, size), `statText`, ports and marks, *Open*, the PR, ⋯; it stays while the mouse is on it (250 ms to get
    there), a wheel, a key or the window's blur hides it; not on a phone or with a pointer other than a mouse, nor for
    a Terminals or Browsers row (`kind`: no port, PR or agent to tell of).
  - A workspace with a PR gets GitHub's mark in the sidebar (`.ws-pr`, its `prState` and failing checks as colors),
    unless `settings.prIcon === false`. Projects show `fork` (a repo) or `folder` (`git: false`).
  - A project's workspaces are in `.project-ws` (indented on a guide line; a line between projects). Rows are inset and
    rounded (hover and selection one item each), the selected one with a short bar (`--ws-bar`: its color or the accent; a
    look's `.ws.sel` background replaces it), `.needs` (a tab of `needsYou`) a bold name; a project with none shows
    *New workspace* (`.ws-new`). A row shows
    `stat` (`.ws-stat`, with `settings.diffStat`) and, on hover, `.ws-acts` (its ⋯ menu) growing in after its marks, which slide left. The PR mark is red
    for an open PR's failing checks only: a merged one stays purple.
  - The sidebar's filter (`find`, the head's funnel, ⌘K): `shows` (words in a name, branch, PR title, author or
    `#n`, and `ONLY`: needs you, working, with a PR); matching rows only, flat (no seps), no drag meanwhile.
  - A PR's author's picture (`Avatar`, Info.tsx: `avatars.githubusercontent.com/<login>`, the CSP's `img-src`) before
    the row's PR mark and in the PR section, unless it's `mine`.
  - ⌘J (`nextNeed`): the next tab of `needsYou` (the Dock count's rule), waiting ones first, in sidebar order.
  - `toast(text, undo?, label?, ok?)`: one message at a time (a newer one restarts the timer; `ok`: done, a check
    and no red); `archive` asks `wsArchive` with
    `ifClean` first and offers Undo (`wsRestore`); a dirty one is confirmed (an older daemon's always is). Deleting a
    workspace and removing a project say so too. `busyWith` puts `going` on the rows meanwhile (a spinner and
    *archiving…* / *deleting…*), Compare's *Keep this one* too.
  - A new workspace stays in sight (`showNew`, from the new-workspace page, a fork, a restore): `reveal` unfolds the
    project and sep holding it, and the one selected before it, once the view has them.
  - The menu bar's screenshot (`bridge.onShot`): `imageSave`, then the new-workspace page with it (`newImages`, a
    `Shot` each: its editor note goes in the prompt as it arrives, the page kept).
  - `making`: workspaces the new-workspace page is making, a row each (`makingRows`, a spinner, *creating…*) where
    `place` puts them; Esc closes the page and they stay until `wsNew`/`wsFan` answers (a dialog opened meanwhile stays).
  - No project: `Welcome` (panels.tsx) with `doctor`'s checks. `settings.dimPanes`: `.dim-panes` on `.app`.
  - While a video plays, a closed sidebar is hidden (`hidden`), not unmounted, so it plays on. The video (`Video` in
    panels.tsx, the foot's play button and ⌘K, the `video` dialog): `text.ts` `youtubeEmbed` turns a link into a `youtube-nocookie.com/embed` URL
    (else refused), an iframe sandboxed without top navigation; the CSP's `frame-src` allows that host, and main sets a
    `Referer` on its requests (`dev.laki.app`): from a `file://` page YouTube's player refuses to play (Error 153).
    `min`: only its bar (the iframe `hidden`, playing on). Its src has `enablejsapi=1`: `videoCommand` (panels.tsx)
    posts `playVideo`/`pauseVideo` to it.
  - Timers (App's `timers`, any number: the foot's button and `startMenu` add one; each a `TimerBar`, panels.tsx, over
    the foot, its time left ticking, its `timerMenu`: more time, start over, what happens as it ends, stop; the `timer`
    dialog, `{ timer: id }` for one's new length, with `text.ts` `parseDuration`): as one ends (`ring`), `TIMER_THEN`'s
    action (pause, play or close the video; with no video, only the notice; `command`: `tabNew` `custom` with the
    timer's `cmd` in its `ws`, the workspace selected when it was picked, not focused; gone or archived, only the
    notice), then `settings.timerSound` (Glass unless set; main's `sound` IPC: `afplay`) and `choose`'s dialog (*Again*:
    the same timer over), or with `settings.timerAlert` `notification`, `notify` with that sound (no tab: it shows the
    window) and a toast. `pause` (the bar's ⏸, its menu): `left` instead of a running `end`; `ring` isn't set for it.
  - Tabs (`tabList`) go in the top bar, or a `.tabstrip` (`data-tabbar`, a drop target too) under or beside the terminals:
    `settings.tabsAt`, top on a phone. `settings.hoverFocus`: a pane the mouse enters (no button held, window focused)
    gets the keyboard (`Panes` `onPointerEnter`).
  - `.side-head` (top): hide, open a project, help; `.side-foot` (pinned at the bottom): Schedule, Board, Video, Meme (`settings.fun`),
    Timer, Settings, with words (`IconButton` `label`) unless `settings.sideLook.labels === false`; one row: App's `fit`
    (a `ResizeObserver`, and the theme's font) sets `data-bare`, how many buttons from the right lose their words, until
    it fits.
  - The project and workspace order is the daemon's (`reorder`).
  - The rail (`rail`: always, but on a phone, whose sidebar is a drawer; Settings › Appearance › Rail) puts `railBar`
    (`.rail`, `railW` as `--rail-w` on `.app`, `.rail-on`) left of the sidebar: a `railButton` per `RAIL` kind (a project's
    `kind`, none: projects) with `railSays` (`needsYou`'s count, a dot while a tab runs), Board and Schedule (`runFailed`: a
    red dot) right after Projects, and Settings at its bottom, which leave the list's `.side-foot` (Video, Meme, Timer stay); Schedule's and Board's pages hide the list (`listOff`: the aside `hidden`, `.list-off`); the list is `listed`, that kind's projects, and `inList` its pinned (a filter: all). An
    effect on the selected workspace sets the kind (`lastIn`: each kind's last, where `railTo` goes back); below `.rail-sep`,
    `railPins` (`pinButton`: `initials` in the workspace's color, a terminal's or browser's icon, `needsYou`'s count; a
    right click is `wsMenu`); `moveWs`
    keeps to the list; `SideHandle` `at`. Its one setting, `railLabels` (off:
    `data-bare`, icons only, `railW` 52).
- **Phones** (`App.tsx`, `useMedia`): `narrow` (≤640px, under the window's minWidth) puts `.narrow` on `.app` (styles.css' last block: the
  sidebar as a drawer, one pane per tab, panels and pages over the main area, terminal font at most 11px);
  `touch` (`pointer: coarse`) shows `KeyBar` (Esc, Tab, ⇧Tab, ⌃C, arrows, ⏎ to the focused pane, ⌨ focuses
  xterm's textarea; its buttons never take the focus). Traffic-light paddings are `.electron` only.
- **`Term.tsx`**: one xterm per pane. In any tab (claude started in a terminal tab too; a shell runs the line on ⌃J), ⌘⏎ and ⇧⏎ send ⌃J (`\n`): a new line in claude's,
  codex's and opencode's prompt, where xterm would send ⏎. It attaches on mount and detaches on unmount, and swallows terminal
  queries unless it is the responder. xterm takes `allowTransparency` only as it opens, so App keys each
  `Term` on `transparent()`: turning glass on or off remounts the terminals. A keypress whose keydown it didn't see is dropped: Enter that closed a
  dialog (and so focused the terminal) would type a stray ⏎. On window focus or a page turning visible it sends
  its size again, so a look is enough to get it back after a phone. OSC 8 links: http(s) open on a click (with the mouse
  captured, `?1000h`…: only on ⌘-click, and a ⌘-press on a link (`over`, the link providers' hover) is kept from the
  app's mouse report by `.xterm-screen`'s listener: codex opens its links itself, two tabs otherwise; in a browser
  elsewhere, no `bridge`, a tap too), `file://` (or a
  bare absolute path) on ⌘-click (⌃ too, unless the mouse is captured) (`allowNonHttpProtocols`, a `title` hint on hover): App's `openPath`, a file of the
  tab's workspace in the preview, else main's `open-path` (the app window's only: a folder in Finder, a document of
  `DOCS` in its app, anything else, bundles too, revealed). Files dropped on it (`bridge.pathOf`) are
  pasted as their paths, shell-quoted when they need it; its `preventDefault` keeps the window's folder drop out.
- **`layout.ts`**: tabs, tmux style. A UI tab is a split tree whose leaves are daemon tabs (sessions), so a
  session is in exactly one tab and nothing nests. Pure functions: `groupsOf` (stored tabs minus ended
  sessions, plus one tab per unplaced session), `move` (a pane or a whole tab to a `Spot`: beside a pane,
  onto its center to trade places with it, or into the tab bar at an index, its own tab; no change: `groups` itself), `insert`, `keep`, `resize`, `place`. Tested in `test/layout.test.ts`.
- **`Panes.tsx`**:
  - panes are absolutely placed siblings keyed by tab, so splitting never remounts a terminal;
  - `useTabDrag`, VS Code style, pointer-based (not HTML5 DnD): a drag starts past 4px (less is a click); a pill
    (`.drag-ghost`) follows the pointer; `overAt` finds the target with `elementFromPoint`: a pane's edge band (`ZONE`,
    30%) or its center, shaded (`.drop-zone`), or a tab bar (`[data-tabbar]`, its `.tab` children in groups' order, the
    flex direction for top/bottom or left/right) and the index between tabs, a line there (`.drop-line`); App's `ok`
    (the drop changes the groups) hides the rest. Esc, a release elsewhere, the window's blur end it with nothing;
    `.tab-dragging` on `<html>`: grabbing, no selection. After a drop the pane's terminal gets the keyboard. Off on a
    phone;
  - `SideHandle` resizes the sidebar.
- **`annotate.ts`** (`annotate.html`, electron-vite's second renderer entry): the menu bar screenshot's editor, a
  window main keeps on top (`annotate()` in main, `bridge.annotate`): crop, arrow, text, rectangle, pen, six colors,
  ⌘Z, a note; *Add to prompt* sends the PNG and note to main (only from that window), which sends `shot` (png, note)
  to the app: the new-workspace page with the image and the note as its prompt. Vanilla TS; in a browser (the dev
  server) a stand-in picture.
- **`floater.ts`** (`floater.html`, the third renderer entry): the floating bubbles (Settings › Appearance;
  `settings.floater`, unset: on). App's `floats` (each workspace whose agent tab works or waits, waiting first, then
  `floaterRecent` (0-5, 3 unset) workspaces whose agent worked last, by `laki.active`, as `idle` or `done` (done first; idle
  longer than `floaterRecentHours`, 4 unset, 0 never: out, a minute's tick ages them); at most `floaterMax`:
  `tab`, name, project, status, its color, what it asked or last said, and `floatMore`'s branch, agents, PR and
  lines for the card), the theme's colors and the options (`style`:
  `floaterStyle`, `cards`: `floaterCards`, `add`: `floaterNew`, `menu`: `floaterMenu`, `voiceTo`: `floaterVoiceTo`) go to
  main (`bridge.floats`);
  main's `placeFloater` shows the bar while Laki isn't in front (`front`: one of its own windows has the focus, not the
  drop, its card or the voice window: a press on the drop makes Laki the active app, and the drop would hide under the
  pointer), and with + on even with no circles; `type: 'panel'` windows over every Space and
  full-screen app: `#bar` (labels: `text.ts` `initials`, two letters, unique, `pr`/`issue`/numbers skipped; a drop against the screen's left or right edge, `data-side` from main's `floater-side`:
  `.shape` with its flares, a slow wobble, a round blob while dragged; the circles; `.fl-btns`: the + (×, `.on`, while
  open) and `ACTS`, the menu bar's: New task, Say it, Screenshot area, Whole screen, and Ask Laki AI while
  `settings.ai.on` (`actsFor`, the floats' `ai`; the menu a row taller: `menuH`); `menu` stack: `.fl-acts` over the + in
  the drop (`floater-size` `up`: main moves `home` so the + stays under the mouse; a hover's name and hint go to the card's
  window, `floater-tip`, cards on or not), card: `#menu`, a focusable panel beside the drop (`MENU`, its foot by the +'s,
  `floater-menu-at`; keys 1-5, arrows, ⏎, Esc; closed on blur, the bar told by `floater-menu`: a press on the + while
  open, or just after a blur closed it (`menuShut`), closes it); its picks are `floater-act` (`new`, `ai`: `aiWin`, `area`: `screenshot`,
  `screen`: `screenPick`, with more than one screen a menu of `screenItems` at the pointer, as the menu bar's submenu; `mic` from the menu: `floater-voice`, the bar opens `#voice`, the stack's opens it itself); New task is
  `new` (main's `newWsWin`, also the menu bar's *New Workspace…*: the renderer's `?window=new`, `NewWindow.tsx`, the new-workspace page alone in a `type: 'panel'`
  window, compact (`.new-window` in styles.css; as tall as the page: `new-fit`, a `ResizeObserver` on the form), pinned over every app and Space, focused without bringing Laki's window forward (`own` leaves it out, so the
  bubbles stay); one at a time, a voice prompt to it is `new-prompt`; it closes itself (`window.close()`) once `wsNew`
  answers, or on Esc), Say it opens `#voice`; a click on a circle is `floater-open`: `show(tab)`; a drag from
  anywhere on it past 4px is `floater-drag` start/move/end with the pointer's screen offset, so its cursors (grab,
  pointer) work, which macOS's drag regions take away (macOS shows them only while Laki is the active app: a hovered
  circle grows instead: `.hot`, set by `pointerover`, not `:hover`, which outlives the bar's hiding as a click brings Laki in front); at the end main's `snap` sticks it to the nearer edge of its screen, animated, and
  `floater.json` in userData keeps where (`home`: a screen gone puts it on the main one, `barAt`, and leaves `home` for
  the screen's return), `#card` (a hover's card, beside the bar toward the screen's middle, click-through: its own
  window so the bar never moves under the mouse; `floater-hover` and `floater-card` show it only while the cursor is
  over the bar and Laki isn't in front: a bar shown again keeps the circle it had under the mouse) and `#voice` (the
  microphone's: a focusable panel, `focus()` makes it key without bringing Laki's window forward; dictation 150 ms
  after the focus; `voiceTo` pick: a "Pick who gets it" row first, nothing sent until one is; new: no list, always a
  new session; `voice-send`: `rpc('send', { whenIdle })` to a tab of the list, or `newWsWin(prompt)`). The card
  and voice windows are the bar page's `window.open` (main's `setWindowOpenHandler` allows only `#card` and `#voice`
  of the same page, one each; `did-create-window` pins them, `pin`'s `to`: their own page's load is a navigation too,
  which `will-navigate` would block): one renderer process, one row in Settings › Resources.
  `floater.css`: the circles' styles (`[data-fstyle]`: glow; gradient, the default; arc; bricks, box-shadow pixel bars stepped behind the initials; comet; wave, two turning rounded squares as a tide; still; idle and done dimmer; `[data-done='on']`: a done one filled green with a slow pulse, `floaterDone` unset or true: App keeps an unseen done one a bubble past `floaterRecent` and its hours),
  also Settings › Appearance's live previews.
- **`Find.tsx`**: the ⌘F bar (`@xterm/addon-search`). Matches are `--find` (yellow); while it's open the
  terminal's `minimumContrastRatio` keeps their text readable.
- **`themes.ts`**: `THEMES`, `applyTheme` (sets the CSS variables on `<html>`, some also under the names Laki
  Go used; `default` leaves the
  stylesheet's), `termTheme` (xterm colors from `--ansi-0…15`). Gradient themes set `--app-bg` and a
  transparent `--term-bg` (xterm runs with `allowTransparency`). A theme after a game or film has an evocative name
  and its `aka` (the game's or film's words), which Settings' theme finder also matches. `--accent-ink` is the accent as text (every `color:`
  of it; fills and borders keep `--accent`): `readable` darkens it (lightens, on a dark theme) to 4.5:1 on the theme's
  background and panels, so a light theme's bright accent stays bright where it fills; `--on-waiting`/`--on-error` are
  labels on those fills (`onAccent`). `test/contrast.test.ts` holds every theme to WCAG ratios (text 4.5; hints, status
  marks and terminal colors 3, a mark on the selection 2.5 (its shape tells it too), the dim grey 2.5; on the main area,
  the sidebar, the rail, panels and the selection; a gradient theme's on both ends): a new theme or color must pass it. A look that fills a selected tab or row gives its marks the text's
  color (look.css' last rules).
- **`look.css`**: the bundled fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono, the other terminal fonts and the interface ones, `themes.ts` `UI_FONTS`; `fonts/NOTICE.md`), syntax colors (`.hl-*`), a look's tab bar
  line as `--tab-line` (a gradient across it as `--tab-line-bg` and `--tab-line-w`, one down it as `--tab-line-img`):
  styles.css' real tab draws it beside the selected tab (the bar's `::before`/`::after`, CSS anchor positioning on the
  tab's `--laki-tab`) and as the tab's border, never under it; not on a phone or the pill looks), glass
  (`html.glass`) and the creative themes' looks (`[data-look=…]`, from a theme's `look`), some selectors also name
  Laki Go's classes. `applyTheme` takes a `Paint` (theme, `uiFont`, glass and its sliders `glassWindow`/`glassSide`/
  `glassTerm` and `glassGlow`, and `sideClear`; `paintOf` picks them from the settings, `paintKey` is what terminals watch). Glass sets
  see-through `--app-bg` (with the glow's radial gradients), `--side` and `--rail-bg` (`glassSide`) and `--term-bg` (`#rrggbbaa`: xterm reads only
  that); `sideClear` (Settings' *Sidebar see-through*, without glass) only `--side` and `--rail-bg`, with `html.side-clear`
  (a clear body, `.main` alone on `--app-bg`; glass in the app too: the sidebar's slider is over the desktop, not the Window one's background) and the window's blur (`blurred`; the new-workspace window never: `NewWindow`'s paint); what floats is nearly opaque, never `backdrop-filter` (over the see-through window Electron repaints it badly:
  flicker, stale tooltips, rectangles around menus); the window's own blur is native
  (`setVibrancy` over IPC, App's `glassed`; `themes.ts` `LESS_CLEAR`: macOS's Reduce transparency turns glass and `sideClear` off in `applyTheme` and `blurred`, Settings notes it under Glass; `MORE_CONTRAST`, Increase contrast: `--muted` and `--line` halfway to `--fg`; App repaints as either changes). `main.tsx` loads the fonts
  before the first render: a terminal measures its cells once.
- **`highlight.ts`**: the file preview's syntax colors, a regex per language family, up to `HL_MAX` (50 KB);
  tokens become React text, never HTML.
- **Sidebar styles** (`settings.sideStyle`, `SIDE_STYLES` in Settings.tsx): `.sidebar[data-style]`; status: `wsRow`'s
  `data-state` (its rollup) colors the row's bar, `.ws-line` fills to `--p` (its agents' highest `progress`); App's `wsRow` adds
  `.ws-sub` (branch, `STATE_WORDS`, progress, PR, diff) for extended and cards, `.ws-last` (the agent's last answer)
  for cards; compact is CSS only. Extended and cards keep the ⋯'s place (`visibility`) and the marks on hover: rows as tall
  as their first line's marks would jump. `sideLook.icons` is `--ws-icon`, every row mark's size (avatar and GitHub's alike).
- **CSV** (`SidePanel.tsx` `CsvTable`, `text.ts` `csvSep`/`parseCsv`/`toCsv`): a `.csv`/`.tsv` preview's Table (or
  Raw, `laki.csv`); editing a cell rewrites the file through `toCsv` (`parseCsv`'s `quoted`, cell by cell: a quoted cell stays quoted, a
  new row's like the row above, a new column's like the cell before; LF only: FilePreview's save puts CRLF back), saved like the
  text edit. ```` ```mermaid ```` blocks: `MarkdownView.tsx` `Mermaid`, the `mermaid` package imported on first use
  (`securityLevel: strict`).
- **`markdown.ts`**: `markdown` (blocks) and `inline`: a Markdown file as a tree (GitHub's common subset), which
  `MarkdownView.tsx`'s `Markdown` (and `Folded`: a few lines, Show more) renders as React nodes (code blocks through `highlight`; links open in the browser,
  images show as links: the preview fetches nothing). `FilePreview` switches Rendered / Raw (`laki.md`; a jump to a
  line opens Raw). Tested in `test/markdown.test.ts`.
- **Artifacts in Files** (`SidePanel.tsx` `Files` `root`, App's `filesRoot`): with a storage folder, Files has
  *Workspace* / *Artifacts* (`PanelApi.artifacts`: `artifactList` as the tree, the preview's `storage` (read-only,
  `openLabel` Open: main's `open-path`), a right click: Open, Show in Finder, Copy path; no new files). The status bar's
  *Artifacts: n* toggles `ArtifactsBar`; its ⋯ (`ArtifactsApi` `reveal('')`, `files`: `artifactsInFiles`) and the big
  view's buttons go to Finder or there.
- **`text.ts`**: `actionsFor` (Run ▾'s actions as it opens: `settings.actions`, then the project's `config.actions`,
  which replace a global one of the same name and target; an agent's only with a live tab of it (`any`: any
  agent's), the focused one first; a shell's to the focused shell, any, or none: each app's `runAction` opens one), `parseMails` (a tunnel's who-gets-in: `@team.com` and `team.com` become `*@team.com`) and
  `MAIL_OK` (what the daemons take: kept in step with their `MAIL`/`mailRe`); prompt templates (`templated`, `fillTemplate`, from `shared/types.ts`: the daemon's `prPrompt` uses it too; `{{prompt}}`, `{{project}}`, `{{base}}`;
  `settings.templates` and a project's `config.templates`, merged by `templatesFor`: the project's first, replacing a
  global one of the same name; filled in by the new-workspace page; `nameOf`: a templated workspace's name from the typed
  prompt, the daemons' first-4-words rule) and `shortPath` (the ⋯'s *Copy path* hint).
- **`PromptInput.tsx`**: a prompt with pasted/dropped images (saved by the daemon) and dictation (the mic's ⌄: where
  macOS picks the microphone and languages, `dictationSettings`); `tools`: the page's pickers at the toolbar's end;
  `withImages` appends their paths. The mic keeps the text box focused and starts dictation 150 ms later: macOS
  learns the web view's text field a moment after focus, and dictation started before that stops at once.
- **`Info.tsx`**: the workspace info panel (`.info-facts`: a card of one-line `Row`s, the whole value in `data-tip`, a
  copy button on hover, a row's `acts` beside it; the path and storage `shortPath`'d, `$PORT` opens `localhost`, each
  public link: `WsInfo.tunnels`, `onCopy`; *from* and *started*, the workspaces `from` ties (`onWs`: it selected), and
  *related* (`refLabel`: PR #n · repo; a PR's *Make it this workspace's PR*, `onPrimary`: `prAttach`; ✕, `onUnrelate`:
  `wsSet` `unrelate`; the PR shown below left out); the PR ⋯'s *Not this workspace's PR* for a linked one, `onDetach`: `prDetach`) and the status bar's PR (`PRStatus`, `AutoToggles`, `ciText`);
  each app maps its workspace to `WsInfo`. `PRSection` (the info panel's and Review's): title, a muted meta line, one row
  of Merge ▾ (`.split.green` when nothing `blocked` it: conflicts, failing or running checks, changes requested, `ready`
false), Approve, then GitHub and ⋯ (checks, files, *Close pull request…*) square at the end (neither Merge nor Approve:
  *Open on GitHub* and ⋯ first in the row), the
  body as `Folded` Markdown (MarkdownView.tsx's: 6 lines, Show more), `Checks` (failing, running, passing, skipped, each
  with `took`, the daemon's seconds, and its URL; a summary line), *Let the agent fix*: `AutoToggles` with `row`, a
  switch per row and *Send now* (`send`) only when there's something to send (failing checks, `threads` open, an
  older daemon's or the info panel's unknown, or conflicts).
- **`ui.tsx`**: line icons (`Icon`, `IconButton`), `Switch` (every on/off: the auto toggles, Settings' rows as
  `switch-row`), popup and right-click menus (`useMenu`, color swatches;
  each item has a key: its own `key` or a free initial, `menuKeys`; `sub`: a line under the label, `pill`/`tone`: a tag at
  its end, `mono`, `foot`: under a line at the bottom, its icon at the end; `items`: a submenu beside it (a hover, a click, → or ⏎; ← or Esc back), as the ⋯ menus' *Open in*; a picked item (`hint` `ON`) is in the accent
  with a check; `{ filter }`: a box on top, letters go to it, ⏎ runs the first label match (else the picked one), Esc
  clears it first; such menus are `.menu.rich`; one flipped above its button is held by its bottom),
  tooltips (`Tips`: any element with `data-tip`; a pressed one shows none until the pointer leaves it, a menu it opens stays clear; `IconButton` `tip={false}`: an `aria-label` only), tab colors (`TAB_COLORS`, `colorVar`: CSS `--tc-<name>`),
  sidebar rows dragged into a new order (`useRowDrag`, `moveId`; rows carry `data-row="kind:id"`), `Page`
  (a page over the main area, like Settings: the new-workspace form), and `ask` (a yes/no in the app's own dialog,
  `AskHost` in App: never `confirm()`, the OS's sheet; its keys stay in it, Esc or outside is no).
- **`Project.tsx`**: a project's page (a click on its name in the sidebar, its ⋯ › *Open project page*; dialog
  `{ project, tab? }`: its ⋯ › Settings opens that tab, else the last one, `laki.projectTab`): Notes (panels.tsx' `NotesView`, also the ⋯ › Notes dialog's:
  an edit saved as it unmounts), Scheduled tasks (Schedules.tsx' rows, a switch each; changes on that page), Memory
  (`Project.memory`, `{ id, text, at, edited }`, the whole list through `projectSet`, which keeps 1000 with an id and
  text; never in MCP's state or `ls --json`) and Settings (Settings.tsx' `ProjectSection`, `noNotes`). The sidebar's
  arrow folds; Terminals and Browsers have no page.
- **`Settings.tsx`**: the settings page (⌘,), autosaved, zoomed by the terminal font size times `settings.pageZoom`
  (`PAGE_ZOOMS`, Appearance's *Settings & Help size*; ⌘± while it or Help is open; Help takes the same zoom; its
  preview cancels that); the nav's sections under a head each (`SECTIONS` `group`: Laki, Agents, Connect); each section's settings in
  `Group`s (a titled card, `.set-group`: a new block of settings goes in one, or a new one); `VarChips` under a
  template (`TEMPLATE_VARS`) and a preset's args or command (`ENV_VARS`) put a variable in at the cursor of the field
  just before them (in a `.preset` card, shown only while it has the focus); presets, `EnvField` (KEY=value lines), fonts,
  `termLook` (line height, weight, cursor… as xterm options; Term takes it as `look`), `termPad` (*Padding*: `.app[data-pad]`, the `.term`'s inset and the preview's padding; tiny on a phone too, roomy not) with a live preview
  (`TermPreview`, keyed on `transparent()` like `Term`), Actions (`ActionsField`, also in each project's section: a duplicate button, a *Show* filter by target), Appearance (themes, the current one outlined and checked, a name filter that stays in sight, a ☆ on each (`favThemes`: Favorites, a group first, each one still in All themes too);
  accent color and corners: `accent`, `radius` in `Paint`, set by `applyTheme` over the theme's and its look's (`radius`
  also as `--rs`, which every fixed px radius in look.css and styles.css takes first, `var(--rs, 10px)`: keep new ones so;
  pills (999px, or half their height: `.pr`, `.tag`, the switch's track) and circles (50%) stay),
  `--accent-fg` by `onAccent`; `tabsAt`;
  `PROJECT_LOOK`: the sidebar's project names over the theme, `settings.projectLook`, App's `phAttrs`/`phVars` put them
  on `.sidebar` as `data-ph-*` and `--ph-*`, styles.css overrides any look with `!important`; `SIDE_LOOK`,
  `settings.sideLook`: the sidebar's lines and rows as CSS values, App's `sideVars` sets `--ws-guide`, `--proj-divider`,
  `--ws-indent`, `--ws-h`, `--ws-font` on `.sidebar`, nearer than the looks' own, set on `[data-look]` at the end of look.css;
  `sideLook.labels === false` hides the bottom buttons' words; interface font, glass: `paint` applies
  them at once, before the save), Prompt templates (`TemplatesField`: `settings.templates`, and each project's; the global sections, it and Actions, open with a `Scope` note, `.set-scope`: Global, everywhere, and where a project's own go; a project's two say *This project*: only there, with the global ones, counted (`mergeActions`, `templatesFor`), and a link to the global list), Remote access (`RemoteSection`, shown when App.tsx
  passes `remote`: the email, 1h…72h or Forever, then the QR code and link), and `ScriptsField` (a project's
  setup/teardown/run scripts, Import from a file), Resources (`ResourcesSection`: `resources` every 3 s while open,
  Laki itself and each tab by RSS with its processes, Sleep/Open/Wake, `settings.sleepAfter`; App.tsx passes a
  `ResourcesApi`), Pull requests (`PR_KINDS`: the PR switches' prompts over `PR_PROMPTS`,
  each with Reset; `prScan`, `prTries`), and General's Export/Import (`laki-settings.json`: `{ laki:
  'settings', version: 1, settings }`; an import goes through `paint`, so it's painted and autosaved like typing, after
  `KINDS` refuses a field of the wrong kind: add a new list, object or number setting there). *Find a setting* (`FIND`: section, the title as the page writes it, more
  words; add new settings there) opens a section and lights (`.spot`) the first label, row or heading that starts with
  the title. Settings' `spot` (App's dialog `{ settings, spot }`: Run ▾'s *Edit the run script…* → Scripts, *Edit actions…* → Actions)
  opens at that `Group`'s card, lit the same way (a ring, a halo and a tint, 2.6 s). Hovering a theme paints it (`applyTheme`), the chosen one again as the mouse leaves `.themes` or the page closes. A
  setting back at its default is saved as that value: an unset key wouldn't replace the saved one. Projects
  are sections of it (`ProjectSection`: name, scripts, env; saved 400 ms after typing and on leaving).
- **`SidePanel.tsx`**: the right panel (⌥⌘B): Files (tree from the daemon's file list, search, new
  file/folder, changed files marked), Changes (the diff by file, Expand all / Collapse all (one button: collapse while any is open), each line with its old and new numbers from the
  hunks; a click opens `CommentBox`: the PR, or the agent; an image, `IMAGE`, is `ImageDiff`: `PanelApi.read` with `base`
  for before, as `<img>`, SVG too, a click for full size), Review (`PRSection` from `Info.tsx` with the open
  threads' count; `ThreadCard`s: file:line, a click previews it there, each comment's author, `ago` of its `at` and its
  body as `Folded` Markdown; resolved ones in a `<details>`), Preview (above; a narrow panel shows the other tabs as icons, a container query); `FilePreview` (a click in Files, or a thread's line), `FileFinder` (⌘P, `findFiles`: a
  basename match first); a right click in Files is App's `fileMenu` (`PanelApi.menu`: default app, browsers for `WEB` files, Open in, Copy path); `RunButton` and `actionMenu` (Run ▾'s Agent and Terminal actions; App's `runMenu(w)`, the toolbar's and a sidebar row's *Run ›*). App.tsx passes a `PanelApi` over the daemon. One right panel at a time: it or
  the info panel.
- **`Tunnel.tsx`**: Expose to the world: the status bar's globe next to each port (`TunnelButton`) and its
  popup: install instructions when cloudflared is missing, who can open it (anyone with the link, the default,
  or only some emails and `*@domain`s), then a QR code and the link; with emails, chips of who gets in, the bad ones flagged. `portsOf`: listening ports plus tunneled ones. App.tsx passes a `TunnelApi`. `QR`: a code
  as SVG, also Remote access's.
- **`Compare.tsx`**: a race's page (`Page` `wide`; dialog `{ compare: <race> }`: a race workspace's menu, ⌘K, and
  right after the new-workspace page's *Race* makes one): a column per live workspace of the race with its status,
  diff size, the agent's last answer and the files `diff` lists (again as `stat` moves); *Keep this one* archives
  the others (`wsArchive`, after a confirm) with *Undo* (`wsRestore`). App.tsx passes a `CompareApi`.
- **`Board.tsx`**: the Board page (`Page` `wide`; the sidebar foot's columns icon, ⌘K, `laki://board`): the
  workspaces (not Terminals' or Browsers') in columns by `columnOf` (`rollup` from `Glyph.tsx`, then the PR's state), cards that open one (a right
  click or `.board-more`: `BoardApi.menu`, App's open, archive, delete; Merged's ⋯: `archiveAll`, one by one), and To
  do (`view.todos`): ▷ or an HTML5 drag onto a column runs `wsNew` with the default agent, then `todoRm`.
- **`Schedules.tsx`**: the Scheduled tasks page (ui.tsx's `Page`; the sidebar foot's clock, ⌘K, a project's ⋯ menu:
  App's `schedulesOf`, the dialog `{ schedules: <project> }`): `.sched-hero` (icon, what it is, filter, New task),
  `.sched-stats` (tasks, on, the next run `soon`, runs ok), a project filter (`only`, starting at `project`, a chip's menu), the form (the
  new-workspace page's `.nw-composer` with the agent's `.nw-pick`, a When field (`.sched-when`; `EXAMPLES` until
  `parseWhen` reads it, then its reading and the next runs), and `.nw-chip`s: project (*Another folder…*: `pick`, the
  folder picker, or a typed path in a browser, then `projectAdd`), where (`WHERE`, or a workspace) and name; the dated
  names), the tasks (`.sched-list`, a row each: its where's icon, name, the rule and a `.sched-next` pill, tags for project,
  agent and where; ▷ and delete on hover; its switch last), the runs' log (`RUNS`, a round mark, `ago`, then
  *Show all*; a click goes to the run's workspace). App.tsx passes a `SchedulesApi`; the clock has a dot (`.ib.dot`) when a run failed after
  `laki.runsSeen` (localStorage: the newest run the page showed).
- **`Usage.tsx`**: the status bar's first item, the plan-limits ring (in the theme's `--accent`, then `--waiting` and `--error`; `UsageButton`: each agent's first window, the shortest: 5-hour; the busier agent's, asked
  every minute; hidden while the daemon has none) and its popup: each agent's windows, bars, when they reset.
  `USAGE_AGENTS` names the agents Settings › Appearance has switches for.
- **`Help.tsx`**: the help page (⌘/, the sidebar's ?, ⌘K): keys, status glyphs, where things are, the main CLI
  commands and recipes (`cli`: the app's command; `ship`: list `ship`), each section a `Sec` of `Item`s. Laid out
  like Settings (`.settings-nav`, `.help-nav`): a filter (focused as it opens, not on a touch screen; ⌘F or / goes to
  it; Esc clears it, then closes the page) keeps the rows with every word typed in their text (`textOf`) or `find`;
  the sections, the one in view lit (a scroll listener: the last whose top passed, the last at the bottom) with its
  named rows under it (chips on a phone); *The full guide* (`GUIDE`, from panels.tsx' `REPO`). Sections and named
  rows have stable ids, `help-<id>`, for a `laki://help#<id>` later. Keep it in step with the guide's keys and CLI
  recipes.
- **`qr.ts`**: a QR encoder (byte mode, level M, versions 1–40, best mask), for the tunnel's link. Its test
  compares a code with macOS CoreImage's (`test/qr.test.ts`).
- **`panels.tsx`**: the new-workspace page (ui.tsx's `Page`: over the main area, like Settings): the prompt's card
  (`PromptInput` `tools`: template, agent (`OTHER_AGENTS` after the presets; each preset's line `presetSays`, Settings'
  default agent as a pill, *Make … the default* in the foot: `settingsSet` `agent`), model (`MODEL_SAYS`: claude's words
  and a cost pill) and effort as `.nw-pick` menus, with a filter),
  then a row of `.nw-chip`s: project and `place` in one menu (each sep indented under its project: `MenuItem`
  `indent`), base with *worktree* (unticked: `local`), name, and *More* (a race, and a typed model only after the model menu's *Another model…* or while one it doesn't list is set: one picker, not two);
  the last choices, `laki.newWs`; `images`: the menu bar's screenshots; while it's made, `.busy` fades the cards and
  `.nw-making` says what's happening and the seconds so far), the palette,
  prompt and add-project dialogs (the last only for the web dev renderer, which has no folder picker), and About
  (`SITE`, the version from `package.json`, the build's time: `__BUILT__`, electron.vite.config.ts' `define`, none
  under `dev:web`; the app menu's *About Laki* is a `laki://about` link, main's `openLink`);
  `Ready` (a workspace without tabs: its starts, `TIPS`) and `StarLaki` (the repo, `REPO`); `Fun` (the sidebar foot's
  smiley: `meme`, Next; a right click on it: copy (a PNG drawn on a canvas, the clipboard takes no other),
  download through an `<a download>`, open on Reddit). A PR's branch is `laki new --pr` (the CLI, the team-prs widget's review): the page has no PR field.
- **`links.ts`**: `parseLink` and `wsLink` (laki:// links, above).
- **`api.ts`**: the WebSocket client. In Electron the address comes from the preload bridge; in a browser,
  from the URL hash.

Laki was built twice while the stack was picked; the Go + Wails build is now its own repository
(`igorkasyanchuk/laki-go`, `~/projects/laki-go`) and nothing here keeps it in step. Many renderer files were
shared with it: some class and variable names in `look.css` and `themes.ts` are its, and harmless here.

## Conventions

- **Keep it small.** Use node's stdlib plus the existing deps (Electron, node-pty, xterm and its addons,
  React, mermaid: the user's call, loaded only for a diagram; BlockNote, Mantine, React Flow and html-to-image: the user's
  call, for specs, loaded only with the Specs page); no new dependencies. Fonts are bundled (`fonts/`: OFL, Hack MIT; each in `NOTICE.md`), never loaded from the web. Mark deliberate shortcuts with a `ponytail:` comment naming the limit.
- **`laki hook` must never fail or block the agent.**
- **Never write** `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.codex/*`. Agents get settings and notify through
  flags only.
- **The daemon only listens on 127.0.0.1**, behind the token and the Origin check. Keep both on any new
  endpoint. Remote access reaches it through cloudflared on this Mac, for one email (or, asked for with a typed
  confirm, anyone with the link), with a token and an origin of its own that end with it; only the page's static files skip the checks.
- **Colors** come from CSS variables in `styles.css` (`:root`). The terminal theme reads them through `css('--…')`.
- **`asar` is off**, because node-pty's helper must be a real file. The packaged daemon runs on Electron's node.
- **Intel**: node-pty is `@lydell/node-pty`, a prebuilt binary per platform in an optional package; npm installs only
  this Mac's, so `pack:x64` adds `@lydell/node-pty-darwin-x64` (`--no-save --force`) before `electron-builder --x64`.
  Nothing else is native. The CLI's `open` and the scripts pick `dist/mac-arm64` or `dist/mac` by architecture.
- **User-facing text** is short and plain. When adding commands or keys, update `docs/guide.md` (keys, CLI),
  `README.md` when it's a main one, and the CLI's usage (`src/shared/usage.ts`, which the agent skill quotes).
- **Commits** end with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Never push.
